# GP Connect Pages Website #

## How to run the website locally? ##

Please follow the following instructions to setting up GitHub Pages to run locally:

[setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/ )

In short...

Make sure you have Ruby 2.X.X installed.

```bash
ruby --version
```

Install bundler using gem.

```bash
gem install bundler 
```

Clone the [gpconnect](https://github.com/nhsconnect/gpconnect.git) Git repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nhsconnect/gpconnect.git
```

Now change into the downloaded/cloned directory and run the 'bundle install' command to install Jekyll.

```bash
bundle install 
```

Run the 'jekyll serve' command to compile and serve the HTML content.

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve 
```

By default pages are served from http://localhost:4005/

You will likely hit two further problems.

1) Fix warnings related to SSL certificate checking (by configuring the SSL_CERT_FILE env variable)

I followed the following instructions to download and reference a cacert.pem file.

2) Fix warnings related to the Jekyll GitHub Metadata plugin (by configuring the JEKYLL_GITHUB_TOKEN env veriable)
