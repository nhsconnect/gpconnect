summary: "Successful Integration Testing With Spine!"
---

In early July end to end integration testing was completed between the [Spine Security Proxy](integration_spine_security_proxy.html) and the GP Connect Demonstrator (developed by [Answer Digital](http://www.answerdigital.com/)) in the Spine DEV environment. This represents a major milestone in the development and delivery of GP Connect APIs with real FHIR&reg; messages flowing to support [Access Record](accessrecord.html) and [Appointment Management](appointments.html) capabilities.
