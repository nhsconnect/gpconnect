- HTML Warnings, Key Indicators, Current Recalls, Patient Details.
- HTML View Clinical Safety & Cross-Vendor Consistency Changes.

## Stage 3. Q4 2016 into Q1 2017 ##

{% include important.html content="It is expected that unbundled direct read-only access to resources will be undertaken in-line with the high-level approach being pursued in other jurisdictions (i.e. Project Argonaut's and specifically the [Argonaut Implementation Guide](http://argonautwiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Implementation_Guide))." %}
