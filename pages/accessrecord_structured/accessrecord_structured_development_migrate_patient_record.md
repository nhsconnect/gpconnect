summary: "Migrate a patient's record in structured format"
---

## Use case ##

Migrate a patient's record from one organisation to another in FHIR&reg; structured format.

## Security ##

- GP Connect utilises TLS Mutual Authentication for system level authorization
- GP Connect utilises JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to transmit clinical audit and provenance details

## Prerequisites ##

### Consumer ###

The consumer system:

- **MUST** have previously resolved the organisation's Access Record Structured FHIR endpoint base URL through the [Spine Directory Service](integration_spine_directory_service.html)
- **MUST** have previously traced the patient's NHS Number using the [Personal Demographics Service](integration_personal_demographic_service.html) or an equivalent service

## API usage ##

### Interaction diagram ###

<img style="height: 400px;" alt="Get structured record interaction diagram" src="images/access_structured/migrate-structured-record-interaction-diagram.png"/>

### Request operation ###

#### FHIR&reg; relative request ####

```http
POST /Patient/$gpc.migratestructuredrecord
```

#### FHIR&reg; absolute request ####

```http
POST https://[proxy_server]/https://[structured_provider_server]/[structured_fhir_base]/Patient/$gpc.migratestructuredrecord
```

#### Request headers ####

Consumers **MUST** include the following additional HTTP request headers:

| Header               | Value |
|----------------------|-------|
| `Ssp-TraceID`        | Consumer's Trace ID (a GUID or UUID) |
| `Ssp-From`           | Consumer's ASID |
| `Ssp-To`             | Provider's ASID |
| `Ssp-InteractionID`  | `urn:nhs:names:services:gpconnect:fhir:operation:gpc.migratestructuredrecord-1`|

Example HTTP request headers:

```http
Accept: application/fhir+json;charset=utf-8
Content-Type: application/fhir+json;charset=utf-8
Ssp-TraceID: 629ea9ba-a077-4d99-b289-7a9b19fd4e03
Ssp-From: 200000000115
Ssp-To: 200000000116
Ssp-InteractionID: urn:nhs:names:services:gpconnect:fhir:operation:gpc.migratestructuredrecord-1
```


#### Authorisation ####

{% include important.html content="The following may need to be moved to the Patient Switching Standard" %}

This interaction can only be used when patient's information is being migrated between GP practices. When a request to migrate the patient's record is made, the provider system **MUST** check that the consumer system is the patient's registered GP practice by checking this against PDS. The following steps will need to be performed:
- The consuming system will need to perform a PDS trace to retrieve the patient's current registered practice
- The consuming system **MUST** record the patient's current registered practice
- The consuming system updates PDS as the patient's registered practice
- The consuming system looks up the previously registered practice's endpoint on SDS
- The consuming system makes a request to migrate the patient's record
- The providing system **MUST** check that the ODS code supplied in the `requesting_organization` claim in the JWT matches the patient's registered practice on PDS

#### Availability of data ####

The record migration use case requires that information is always available regardless of whether the [structured capability has been enabled](development_api_non_functional_requirements.html#enablement), or whether clinical areas have been turned off using [configuration for clinical areas](accessrecord_structured_development_clinical_area_config.html).


#### Payload request body ####

The payload request body comprises a `Parameters` resource, conforming to the [GPConnect-MigrateStructuredRecord-Operation-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/OperationDefinition/GPConnect-MigrateStructuredRecord-Operation-1/_history/1.15) `OperationDefinition` profile.

The `Parameters` resource is populated with the parameters shown below.  Note: The â†³ character indicates a part parameter.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Optionality</th>
      <th>Cardinality</th>
      <th>Comments</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="highlighter-rouge">patientNHSNumber</code></td>
      <td><code class="highlighter-rouge">Identifier</code></td>
      <td>Mandatory</td>
      <td>1..1</td>
      <td>NHS Number of the patient for whom to retrieve the structured record.</td>
    </tr>


    <tr>
      <td><code class="highlighter-rouge">includeFullRecord</code></td>
      <td><code class="highlighter-rouge"></code></td>
      <td>Mandatory</td>
      <td>1..1</td>
      <td>Include the patient's full clinical record in the response.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><span style="white-space: nowrap;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8627; <code class="highlighter-rouge">includeSensitiveInformation</code></span></td>
      <td><code class="highlighter-rouge">Boolean</code></td>
      <td>Mandatory</td>
      <td>1..1</td>
      <td>
        Include confidential and sensitive information in the response, this parameter has a default value of 'true'. This parameter can only be set to true if an appropriate `requested_scope` value is provided in the JWT, more guidance is available in the  <a href="integration_cross_organisation_audit_and_provenance.html#requested_scope-claim">Cross-organisation audit and provenance page</a>
        <p><i>Part parameter: may only be provided if <code>includeFullRecord</code> is set.</i></p>        
      </td>
    </tr>



  </tbody>
</table>


The example below shows a fully populated `Parameters` resource as a request to the `$gpc.migratestructuredrecord` operation:

```json
{
  "resourceType": "Parameters",
  "parameter": [
    {
      "name": "patientNHSNumber",
      "valueIdentifier": {
        "system": "https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/nhs-number",
        "value": "9999999999"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "includeFullRecord",
      "part": [
        {
          "name": "includeSensitiveInformation",
          "valueBoolean": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Error handling ####

The provider system **MUST** return a [GPConnect-OperationOutcome-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/GPConnect-OperationOutcome-1/_history/1.2) resource that provides additional detail when one or more data field is corrupt or a specific business rule/constraint is breached.

The table below shows common errors that may be encountered during this API call, and the returned Spine error code.  Please see [Error handling guidance](development_fhir_error_handling_guidance.html) for additional information needed to create the error response, or to determine the response for errors encountered that are not shown below.

Errors returned due to parameter failure **MUST** include diagnostic information detailing the invalid parameter.
