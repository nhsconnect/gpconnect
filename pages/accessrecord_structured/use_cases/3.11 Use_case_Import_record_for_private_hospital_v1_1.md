summary: "Use case for import patient record for a private hospital"
---

## Brief description
Upon admission to or attendance at a private hospital it is necessary to record the patient’s current medications, allergies, diagnosis and conditions on the local clinical system. This is currently very difficult for private hospitals as they do not have access to NHS systems such as the Summary Care Record (SCR).

## Use case justification
Clinical and administration:
-   Access to accurate information at the point of care reducing the opportunity for errors to occur.
-   Reduction in transcription between systems and paper to IT, leading to a reduction in prescribing errors.
-   Reduction in clinical time wasted, away from the patient, collecting and collating information.
-   Reduction in clinical time wasted, away from the patient, manually updating IT systems.
-   Reducing the paper flow through departments by utilising the system workflow to manage tasks using staff time efficiently.

Patient-focused:
-   Security of patient information is maintained and improved through the reduction of paper-based ‘patient identifiable documents’ in use within departments.
-   Increased patient/clinician time due to reduction in clinician time spent collecting and transcribing information away from the patient.
-   Increased patient safety due to the reduction in manual transcription errors.
-   Better patient experience as they are not being asked for information which should already be available to the clinician.

## Primary actors
-   Clinician
-   Hospital system
-   GP Connect
-   GP clinical system

## Secondary actors
-   Patient

## Triggers
-   Patient is admitted to or attends a private hospital for treatment.

## Preconditions
-   The patient’s details have been verified and entered on the hospital system upon admission/attendance.
-   Hospital staff have the correct/appropriate system access rights.
-   The patient’s GP has agreed to share patient information via GP Connect.
-   The patient allows this shared information to be viewed/used by hospital staff.
-   Electronic interactions between hospital system(s)/GP Connect/GP clinical system have been correctly configured.

## Postconditions
-   **On success:**
    - Clinical information is imported and recorded against the local patient record.

-   **Guaranteed:**
    - A full history of medications, allergies, diagnosis and conditions is recorded on the hospital system.
