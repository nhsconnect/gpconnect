summary: "Use case for a care professional user of the local care record reviews a patient’s GP Practice risks and warnings"
---

## Brief description
A patient is admitted to hospital. The clinician responsible for the care of that patient in the hospital needs to review their care history and their recorded current and past risks and warnings from the GP practice clinical system to assist in determining the appropriate care provision and support. They have access to the LCR, which shares clinical information relevant to the direct care of their patient from a variety of local hospital, community and GP organisations.

## Use case justification
Currently, when a patient’s record is viewed in the LCR, their current and past risks and warnings from the GP practice clinical system are presented as a static HTML view from a third-party supplier, which is rigid and not in keeping with the needs of professionals, the design of the system’s UI – nor is it the preferred strategy for sharing patient information within the LCR landscape. Electronically consuming the FHIR®-compliant profiles for a patient’s current and past problems from their GP practice clinical system will allow the LCR to:

-   Share this data in a manner which is congruent and consistent with all other care partners.
-   Present the data in a manner which is appropriate for the care setting.
-   Share more relevant data, pertinent to the role of the professional involved and improve care delivery.
-   Present the data in a uniform and streamlined interface.
-   Provider a higher quality user experience.
-   Provide a higher fidelity audit record.

## Primary actors
-   Care professionals
-   Clinicians
-   LCR subsystem

## Secondary actors
-   Patient

## Triggers
-   At the point of direct care, during a consultation or care delivery setting, the professional/clinician is discussing the medical history with their patient.

## Preconditions
-   Patient has been admitted onto the hospital’s Patient Administration System (PAS) and has gone through identification including retrieving their NHS Number.
-   The clinician has been advised by the local hospital’s system that their patient has information available within the LCR.
-   The clinician is logged into, and has a valid session with, the LCR.
-   The clinician has relevant access and permission to view the patient’s details in the LCR.
-   The patient has been registered within the GP practice clinical system and has data available for sharing with other clinical systems. <strong>Note:</strong> If no such data is available, it will not be possible to initiate the basic flow.
-   The GP practice clinical system exists within the Spine Secure Proxy (SSP).

## Postconditions
-   **On success:**
    - The patient’s list of current and past risks and warnings is taken from the GP practice clinical system and presented in the LCR.
-   **Guaranteed:**
    - Access and data returned is recorded for auditing purposes.
