summary: "Use case for referral to single point of access for mental health"
---

## Brief description
A patient is referred for mental health treatment via a single point of access (SPA). Where the relevant patient information has not been included with the referral form, the SPA team will have access to the patient’s GP record to ensure that the patient’s history is included in the referral. This will save time and resources of requesting this from the patient’s GP.

## Use case justification
Clinical and administration:
-   Access to accurate information at the point of care reducing the opportunity for errors to occur.
-   Reduction in time wasted, collecting and collating information.
-   Reduction in time wasted, manually updating IT systems.
-   Reducing the paper flow through departments/organisations by utilising the system workflow to manage tasks using staff time efficiently.

Patient-focused:
-   Security of patient information is maintained and improved through the reduction of paper-based ‘patient identifiable documents’ in use within departments.
-   Increased patient safety due to the reduction in manual transcription errors.
-   Better patient experience as there is less likely to be a delay in referral.

## Primary actors
-   Single Point of Access (SPA) team 
-   Paris system
-   GP Connect
-   GP clinical system

## Secondary actors
-   Patient

## Triggers
-   Patient is referred to mental health services using the Single Point of Access services and the relevant patient information has not been included in the referral form.

## Preconditions
-   The patient’s details have been verified and entered on the Paris system.
-   SPA staff have the correct/appropriate system access rights.
-   The patient’s GP has agreed to share patient information via GP Connect.
-   The patient allows this shared information to be viewed/used by GP staff.
-   Electronic interactions between Paris system/GP Connect/GP clinical system have been correctly configured.

## Postconditions
-   **On success:**
    - Clinical information is imported and recorded against the local patient record.

-   **Guaranteed:**
    - All the relevant available information on the patient’s medical history has been viewable on the Paris system used by the Single Point of Access team.
