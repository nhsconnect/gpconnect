## Use Case Name

Active Checking of a prescription in Unscheduled Care.

## Brief Description

A patient presents at unscheduled care (Urgent Care, Minor Injuries,
Walk-in Centre, Mental Health Crisis Team) and a clinician needs to
prescribe medication for the patient. They have access to Electronic
Prescribing and Medicine Administration System (EPMA) which includes
decision support (checks for allergies, adverse reactions and medical
conditions).

The flow of information will be from the GP Practice Clinical System
into the EPMA.

Information must be SNOMED coded for Allergies, Adverse Reactions and
Conditions. Allergies and Adverse Reactions must include SNOMED coding
for the allergen as a minimum. Conditions must be SNOMED coded.

These are required for Active Checking support in EPMA systems to cross
check against the contraindications from the Drug File.

This is in an unscheduled care setting, and as such data sharing
agreements should not be required, this should only respect patient’s
consent to share.

## Use Case Justification

In an unscheduled care setting the patient may not be able to
communicate in detail the details of allergies, adverse reactions or
conditions that are relevant to prescribing. They may do so in a lay or
generic terminology and this will not be clearly medically confirmed for
the purposes of active checking of medication on prescribing.

As the patient’s GP is likely to have this information recorded,
including the provenance and details of that information (i.e. type and
severity of the allergic reaction and if this is medically confirmed,
reported by a clinician or just reported by the patient), automatically
importing this information on registration at the unscheduled care
location will ensure that this:

1.  Happens

2.  Is recorded accurately

3.  Does not require repeated querying of the patient for known data.

Discharge summaries supplied from Unscheduled Care settings are required
to provide this information in a structured form
(<https://isd.hscic.gov.uk/trud3/user/guest/group/41/pack/34/subpack/240/releases>)

## Primary Actors

- Clinician (Doctor, Nurse Prescriber), EPMA

## Secondary Actors

- Patient

## Triggers

- Clinician prescribes medication to the patient.

## Pre-Conditions

-   Patient has been registered in attendance at the Unscheduled Care
    location and has gone through identification including retrieving
    their NHS Number.

-   The clinician is a qualified prescriber with access to create
    Allergies, Adverse Reactions, Conditions and prescribe medication
    within the EPMA system.

## Post Conditions

-   **On Success:**

    Allergies, Adverse Reactions and Conditions are imported and
    recorded against the patient record in the EPMA.

-   **Guaranteed:**

	The list of allergies, adverse reactions and conditions are recorded on the EPMA. Access is recorded for auditing purposes.

## Basic Flow with Alternative and Exception Flows

*{The basic flow is the best case scenario (i.e. the happy path) of what
should happen in the use case if all the conditions are met. Describe
other allowed variations of the basic flow. Are the any alternate routes
that can be taken? Describe Error Conditions or what happens when a
failure occurs in the flow}*
