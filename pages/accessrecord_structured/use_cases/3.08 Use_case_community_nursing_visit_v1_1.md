summary: "Use case for community nurse reviews the GP record when they visit a patient"
---

## Brief description
Either ahead of or during a visit a community nurse can review a patient’s record.

## Use case justification
Clinical and administration:
-   Access to accurate information at the point of care, reducing the opportunity for errors to occur.
-   Data can be formatted and filtered by the local system, so the clinician is presented the information they need in a suitable format.

Patient-focused:
-   Security of patient information is maintained and improved through the reduction of paper-based ‘patient identifiable documents’ in use within departments.
-   Increased patient/clinician time due to reduction in clinician time spent collecting and transcribing information away from the patient.
-   Better patient experience as they are not being asked for information which should already be available to the clinician.

## Primary actors
-   Community nurse
-   Community system
-   GP Connect
-   GP clinical system

## Secondary actors
-   Patient

## Triggers
-   The community nurse is visiting or preparing to visit a patient.

## Preconditions
-   The community nurse has the correct/appropriate system access rights.
-   The patient’s GP has agreed to share patient information via GP Connect.
-   The patient allows this shared information to be viewed/used by the community nurse.
-   Electronic interactions between community system/GP Connect/GP clinical system have been correctly configured.

## Postconditions
-   **On success:**
    - The community nurse can view the GP patient’s record and use it to assist in making clinical decision.
