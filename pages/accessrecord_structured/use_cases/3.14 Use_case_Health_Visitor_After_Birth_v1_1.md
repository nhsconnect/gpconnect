summary: "Use case for health visitor appointments during a child’s early years"
---

## Brief description
A health visitor will have four mandatory visits with each child and mother over the first few years of the child’s life. These take place at 10 days, 6-8 weeks, 9-12 weeks and 2-2½ years. Before each appointment, the health visitor needs to collect all information about the child to provide the best possible care to the child during development. The health visitor seeing the child will have full access to the child’s record. They may also request access to the mother’s and father’s GP record.

## Use case justification
Clinical and administration:
-   Access to accurate information at the point of care reducing the opportunity for errors to occur.
-   Reduction in clinical time wasted, away from the patient, collecting and collating information.
-   Reduction in clinical time wasted, away from the patient, manually updating IT systems.
-   Reducing the paper flow through departments/organisations by utilising the system workflow to manage tasks using staff time efficiently.

Patient-focused:
-   Security of patient information is maintained and improved through the reduction of paper-based ‘patient identifiable documents’ in use within departments.
-   Increased patient/clinician time due to reduction in clinician time spent collecting and transcribing information away from the patient.
-   Increased patient safety due to the reduction in manual transcription errors.
-   Better patient experience as the parents are not being asked for information which should already be available to the clinician.

## Primary actors
-   Health visitor
-   Community system
-   GP Connect
-   GP clinical system

## Secondary actors
-   Patient

## Triggers
The community health visitor will visit the child at:
-   10 days
-   6-8 weeks
-   9-12 weeks
-   2-2½ years

## Preconditions
-   The patient’s details have been verified and entered on the community system.
-   Health visitors have the correct/appropriate system access rights.
-   The patient’s GP has agreed to share patient information via GP Connect.
-   The patient allows this shared information to be viewed/used by GP staff.
-   Electronic interactions between community system/GP Connect/GP clinical system have been correctly configured.

## Postconditions
-   **On success:**
    - Clinical information is imported and made available to the clinician.
-   **Guaranteed:**
    - All the relevant available information on the patient’s medical history has been viewable on the community system used by health visitors.
