## Degraded medications

Where degraded medication records arising from GP2GP record transfer are present in the patient record then these **MUST** be coded using the appropriate degrade code (`196421000000109`, Transfer-degraded medication entry) with the original medication name conveyed by `CodeableConcept.text`.

## Medication interoperability

Consumers of medication resources generated by other systems **MUST** consider the clinical safety issues arising from processing medication information recorded in different care settings and contexts, and seek clinical safety guidance where appropriate. 

Key concerns are the understandability of received medication information and appropriate actions to degrade and identify medication concepts which are not understood by the receiving system. Appropriate clinical workflows may also be required at the receiver - for example, deactivation of received medications such that they **MUST** be explicitly re-authorised to make them issuable.

Currently dosage and quantity information are expressed in unstructured/textual form. A system intending to consume dosage and quantity information needs to be capable of handling unstructured quantities and dosages.

## Mixtures 

In some systems it is possible to prescribe custom formulations compounded from other medications (extemporaneous preparations). Mixtures **MUST** be expressed using the degrade code (`196421000000109`, Transfer-degraded medication entry) with the constituents of the mixture expressed via `CodeableConcept.text`.

## Non dm+d medications

In some cases, drugs may be recorded as free text or may be present in the original system’s drug dictionary, but not in dm+d. Where no dm+d code is available to describe the medication then the medication code **MUST** be expressed using the degrade (`196421000000109`, Transfer-degraded medication entry) with the original drug name present in `CodeableConcept.text`. 

## dm+d name versus displayed name

It is possible for historic/legacy medications to be displayed with a name corresponding to the name in the original system’s drug dictionary rather than the dm+d name. This name **SHOULD** be preserved via `CodeableConcept.text` when representing the medication via resources. `CodeableConcept.text` is redundant when the displayed medication name on the original system and the dm+d name is identical, and, in these cases, `CodeableConcept.text` **SHOULD** be omitted.

## Medication reviews

The resources required to describe diarised review activities and reminders for medication reviews are out of scope for this guidance. 

## Future-dated prescriptions

Medication issues may be future-dated – for example, repeat dispensed medications or a deferred acute medication that may not be needed if the condition resolves.

## Amendments

Where an authorisation is amended – for example, Proprietary/Generic switch, altered dates, change of quantities and so on, then the existing authorisation/plan **SHOULD** be stopped or discontinued, and an appropriate reason supplied via `statusReason.reason`. A new authorisation **SHOULD** be created, in the form of a `MedicationStatement` and `MedicationRequest` with `intent` of `plan`, to hold the amended details. Subsequent issues of the medication **SHOULD** reference the amended authorisation rather than the previous version.

## Medication discontinuation/stopping ###

Where a medication is stopped or discontinued then the status of the authorisation **SHOULD** be changed to 'stopped' and a textual stop reason provided via `statusReason.reason`.

A `statusReason` **SHOULD NOT** be generated when an authorisation has simply expired (exceeded review date or number of issues).

## Authorisation 

In conjunction with `MedicationStatement`, a `MedicationRequest` with an `intent` of `plan` represents an authorisation for acute, repeat, repeat dispensed medication.

## Re-authorisation 

Where a medication is re-authorised a new authorisation **SHOULD** be generated in the form of a `MedicationStatement` and `MedicationRequest` with `intent` of `plan`. Subsequent issues of the medication **SHOULD** reference the new authorisation.
