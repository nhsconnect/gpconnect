## Linkages ##
One of the purposes in developing the FHIR&reg; profiles is to ensure that clinical data is, as much as possible, presented the same way regardless of the provider system. This ensures the consuming system (and clinician) will always know where to look for each type of information.

However, information about the patient is not just held within the profiles but in how those profiles are linked together.

For example, linking a medication to a problem means that as well as the record showing what the patient is taking, it also explains why they are taking it.

For a consuming system to be able to interpret this linkage information correctly, it needs to be presented in the same way regardless of the providing system.

### GP Connect FHIR&reg; model ###
To support this, GP Connect has developed a FHIR model that identifies all the GP Connect FHIR profiles and how they are related together to store the patient record.

The model currently covers Consultations, Problems, Medications and Medical Devices, Allergies, Immunisations, Uncategorised Data, Referrals, Investigations, Documents and Diary Entries. Other clinical areas will be added as they are developed.

The relationships between two FHIR profiles are recorded in only one of the linked FHIR profiles (similar to in a relational database management system). This is shown by the direction of the arrow in the FHIR model.

For example, the `MedicationStatement` profile contains a field that can be used to look up the linked `Medication`. There is no field in the `Medication` profile that can be used to look up the linked `MedicationStatement`.

## FHIR profiles returned on query ##
When a consumer system requests data on a clinical area the information is returned across a number of FHIR profiles. Choosing which FHIR profiles to return is a balancing act between including enough linked profiles to give the consumer system a comprehensive response to their query but not including so many linked profiles as to swamp the consumer system with data.

The three main considerations used to decide which data to return for each clinical area were:
* include all the FHIR profiles required to fully describe the requested clinical area
* include the FHIR profiles required to define all the linkages from the requested clinical area
* include the FHIR profiles from linked clinical areas where they are key to understanding the requested clinical area
For each clinical area in a query that returns data a list should be generated that contains links to all data items returned for that clinical area.

### Dealing with confidential items ###

Any clinical area that has not returned an item as it was confidential **SHALL** populate the relevant list with the warning code `confidential-items` as specified in the [resource population fundamentals page](https://gpconnect-1-3-2.netlify.com/accessrecord_structured_development_resources_overview.html).

Problems are an exception to this rule. It is only necessary to indicate if a problem has not been returned due to confidentiality when responding to a specific problem query. Where problems are due to be returned as they are linked to an item returned as part of a query for a different clinical area, e.g. a medication query, but are omitted for confidentiality reasons  **MUST NOT** be marked with a warning code.

The reason for the exception in the case of problems is due to the fact that problem linkages are applied manually and are therefore not consistent across the GP estate. As not everything that could be considered a problem will be linked then to warn that a problem was missing could lead to confusion as this is also possible when the warning is not present.

### Consultations ###
When GP Connect returns a consultation it will supply the metadata of the consultation and all the clinical data that was recorded during the consultation.

<div class="screen-reader-text">
This diagram is explained in the following text:
</div>

The response to the query includes:
* A `List` profile containing references to `Encounter` for every Consultation that met the search criteria
* A `List` profile for each clinical area that data exists in the bundle

For each `Encounter` referenced in the `List` profile:
*  The `Encounter` profile of the Consultation
*	The `List` profiles that describe the structure of the Consultation
*	The `ProblemHeader (Condition)` profile of any directly linked Problems
*	The `MedicationRequest`, `MedicationStatement` and `Medication` profiles of any linked Medications or Medical Devices
    * Always include the `MedicationStatement`, `MedicationRequest` (intent = plan) and `Medication` profiles
    * Only include `MedicationRequest` (intent = order) for directly linked issues
    *	Include the `ProblemHeader (Condition)` profile of any Problems linked to the returned Medications and Medical Devices
*	The `AllergyIntolerance` profile of any linked Allergies
    *	Include the `ProblemHeader (Condition)` profile of any Problems linked to the returned Allergies
*	The `Immunization` profile of any linked Immunisations
    *	Include the `ProblemHeader (Condition)` profile of any Problems linked to the returned Immunisations
*	The `Observation` profile of any linked Uncategorised Data
    *	Include the `ProblemHeader (Condition)` profile of any Problems linked to the returned Uncategorised Data
*	The `ReferralRequest` profile of any linked Referrals
    *	Include the `ProblemHeader (Condition)` profile of any Problems linked to the returned Referrals
*	The `DocumentReference` profile of any linked Documents
    * Only include the document metadata in any returned `DocumentReference` profile, do not include the binary file
    *	Include the `ProblemHeader (Condition)` profile of any Problems linked to the returned Documents
*	The `DiagnosticReport`, `ProcedureRequest`, `Observation`, `Specimen` and `DocumentReference` profiles of any linked Investigations
    * Only include the document metadata in any returned `DocumentReference` profile, do not include the binary file.
    *	Include the `ProblemHeader (Condition)` profile of any Problems linked to the returned Investigation    
*  The `ProcedureRequest`profile of any linked Diary Entries
    * Include the `ProblemHeader (Condition)` profile of any Problems linked to the returned Diary Entries
*  All administrative profiles referenced directly (or via another administrative profile) by any of the clinical profiles included above
    * Include `Patient`, `Organization`, `PractitionerRole`, `Practitioner` and `Location`.


Where a Consultation links to a profile that is not yet supported by the provider system then it is not included in the response. Details on how this is done can be found in the [Consultation Guidance](accessrecord_structured_development_consultation_guidance.html).

Clinical items within the Consultation are always included in the response regardless of their inclusion/exclusion in other parts of the query.
So, for example, if a consumer requests a Consultation that contains a Medication but does not explicitly request Medications in the query, the provider will still include the Medication contained in the Consultation as part of its response.

### Problems ###
When GP Connect returns a problem it will supply the metadata and description of the problem and all the clinical data that has been linked to the problem.

Where a Problem links to a profile that is not yet supported by the provider system, then it is not included in the response. Details on how this is done can be found in the [Problem Guidance](accessrecord_structured_development_problems_guidance.html).

Clinical items linked to the Problem are always included in the response regardless of their inclusion/exclusion in other parts of the query.
So, for example, if a consumer requests a Problem that links to a Medication but does not explicitly request Medications in the query, the provider will still include the Medication linked to the Problem as part of its response.

### Medications and medical devices ###
When GP Connect returns a medication or medical device it will supply the prescription plan information. If asked for by the consumer, GP Connect will also return all the prescription issues made under the plan.
