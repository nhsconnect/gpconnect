## Introduction ##

The headings below list the elements of the MedicationStatement resource and describe how to populate and consume them.

{% include important.html content="Any element not specifically listed below **MUST NOT** be populated or consumed." %}

{% include tip.html content="You'll find it helpful to read it in conjunction with the underlying [MedicationStatement profile definition](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-GPC-MedicationStatement-1/_history/1.2)" %}

{% include note.html content="It is not expected that suppliers will provide resources for data types that reference resources that have not been curated and published by GP Connect. In the case where these fields are required it is not expected they will be populated until the resources have been developed by the suppliers and completed the relevant NHS Digital assurance." %}

## MedicationStatement elements ##

### id ###

<table class='resource-attributes'>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Data type:</b> <code>Id</code></td>
    <td><b>Optionality:</b> Mandatory</td>
    <td><b>Cardinality:</b> 1..1</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The logical identifier of the MedicationStatement resource.

### meta.profile ###

<table class='resource-attributes'>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Data type:</b> <code>uri</code></td>
    <td><b>Optionality:</b> Mandatory</td>
    <td><b>Cardinality:</b> 1..1</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The MedicationStatement profile URL.

Fixed value [https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-GPC-MedicationStatement-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-GPC-MedicationStatement-1)

### extension[lastIssueDate] ###

<table class='resource-attributes'>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Data type:</b> <code>dateTime</code></td>
    <td><b>Optionality:</b> Required</td>
    <td><b>Cardinality:</b> 0..1</td>
  </tr>
</table>

When the medication was last issued.

### extension[prescribingAgency] ###

<table class='resource-attributes'>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Data type:</b> <code>CodeableConcept</code></td>
    <td><b>Optionality:</b> Mandatory</td>
    <td><b>Cardinality:</b> 1..1</td>
  </tr>
</table>

This details the care setting in which the medication was prescribed. Currently this will only detail if the medication was prescribed by the GP practice or by another organisation, however in the future this valueset could be built on to be more specific about where a medication was prescribed. For instance, if the patient was prescribed a medication by a hospital or bought a medication over the counter then this would be indicated here.

For repeat and repeat dispensed medications the value identifies the care setting where the medication plan (rather than any specific issue in the plan) was authorised.

### identifier ###

<table class='resource-attributes'>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Data type:</b> <code>Identifier</code></td>
    <td><b>Optionality:</b> Mandatory</td>
    <td><b>Cardinality:</b> 1..*</td>
  </tr>
</table>

This is for business identifiers.

This is sliced to include a cross care setting identifier which **MUST** be populated. The codeSystem for this identifier is `https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/cross-care-setting-identifier`.

This **MUST** be a GUID.

*Providing* systems **MUST** ensure this GUID is globally unique and a persistent identifier (that is, it doesn't change between requests and therefore stored with the source data).

Where *consuming* systems are integrating data from this resource to their local system, they **MUST** also persist this GUID at the same time.

### basedOn ###

<table class='resource-attributes'>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Data type:</b> <code>Reference</code></td>
    <td><b>Optionality:</b> Mandatory</td>
    <td><b>Cardinality:</b> 1..1</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Link to the MedicationRequest that this `MedicationStatement` is based on.

Every MedicationStatement **MUST** be based on a `MedicationRequest` with `intent` set to `plan`.

### context ###

<table class='resource-attributes'>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Data type:</b> <code>Reference(Encounter)</code></td>
    <td><b>Optionality:</b> Required</td>
    <td><b>Cardinality:</b> 0..1</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The `Encounter` within which the medication was authorised.

As per base profile guidance.

### status ###

<table class='resource-attributes'>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Data type:</b> <code>code</code></td>
    <td><b>Optionality:</b> Mandatory</td>
    <td><b>Cardinality:</b> 1..1</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The status of the authorisation.

Use one of `active`, `completed` or `stopped`:

- `active` represents an active authorisation - used for active repeat medications
- `stopped` represents an authorisation which has been discontinued, cancelled or stopped
- `complete` represents an authorisation which has run its course

For repeat and repeat dispensed the status refers to the status of the plan (the entire cycle of prescriptions).

For acute the status refers to the status of the prescription issue.

### medicationReference ###

<table class='resource-attributes'>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Data type:</b> <code>Reference(Medication)</code></td>
    <td><b>Optionality:</b> Mandatory</td>
    <td><b>Cardinality:</b> 1..1</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The medication the authorisation is for.

The `Medication` resource provides the coded representation of the medication.

### effective ###

<table class='resource-attributes'>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Data type:</b> <code>Period</code></td>
    <td><b>Optionality:</b> Required</td>
    <td><b>Cardinality:</b> 0..1</td>
  </tr>
</table>

`Period.start` is **MANDATORY**. Where there is no defined start date this is populated with the recorded date.

`Period.end` is **REQUIRED**. Where there is a defined expiry or end date or where the end date can be derived (for example - from the duration) the end date **MUST** be supplied.

For repeats and repeat dispensed this refers to the period of the plan (the entire cycle of prescriptions).

For acutes this refers to the period of the prescription issue.

### dateAsserted ###

<table class='resource-attributes'>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Data type:</b> <code>dateTime</code></td>
    <td><b>Optionality:</b> Mandatory</td>
    <td><b>Cardinality:</b> 1..1</td>
  </tr>
</table>

When this medication statement was believed true.

Unless there is a distinct user-modifiable availability date/time for the authorisation, this is the audit trail date/time for when the authorisation was entered.

### subject ###

<table class='resource-attributes'>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Data type:</b> <code>Reference(Patient)</code></td>
    <td><b>Optionality:</b> Mandatory</td>
    <td><b>Cardinality:</b> 1..1</td>

    <td><b>Cardinality:</b> 1..1</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Whether a medication was taken.

Providers **MUST** use a default value of `unk` – unknown.

This item is mandatory in the base FHIR profile but GP systems do not record this detail therefore we have been forced to pick a default value and this information should not be used.

This element has been included in this section as providers **MUST** populate it. However, as the data should not be used it has also been included in the ‘Do not use’ section below.

### reasonCode ###

<table class='resource-attributes'>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Data type:</b> <code>CodeableConcept</code></td>
    <td><b>Optionality:</b> Optional</td>
    <td><b>Cardinality:</b> 0..*</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The coded reason for authorising the medication.

{% include tip.html content="Please see [CodeableConcept and common code systems](accessrecord_structured_development_resources_overview.html#codeableconcept-and-common-code-and-identifier-systems) when populating this element." %}

### reasonReference ###

<table class='resource-attributes'>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Data type:</b> <code>Reference(Condition), Reference(Observation)</code></td>
    <td><b>Optionality:</b> Optional</td>
    <td><b>Cardinality:</b> 0..*</td>
  </tr>
</table>

References the condition or observation that was the reason for this authorisation.

Unless there is a specific linkage in the context of medication, indirect linkages to be handled via Problem list.

### note ###

<table class='resource-attributes'>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Data type:</b> <code>Annotation</code></td>
    <td><b>Optionality:</b> Required</td>
    <td><b>Cardinality:</b> 0..*</td>
  </tr>
</table>

All notes that are associated with this medication record.

All patient notes and prescriber notes at authorisation(plan) and issue(order) level **MUST** be included in this field. They **MUST** be concatenated and indicate the level the notes come from (for example, 1st Issue) and be prefixed with either ‘Patient Notes:’ or ‘Prescriber Notes:’ as appropriate.

### dosage.text ###

<table class='resource-attributes'>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Data type:</b> <code>String</code></td>
    <td><b>Optionality:</b> Mandatory</td>
    <td><b>Cardinality:</b> 1..1</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Complete dosage instructions as text.

In exceptional cases where for legacy data there is no dosage recorded in the system then this MUST be populated with the text 'No information available'.

### dosage.patientInstruction ###

<table class='resource-attributes'>
