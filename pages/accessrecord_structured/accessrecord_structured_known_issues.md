## Allergy interoperability and clinical safety ##

Allergies are currently recorded using multiple schemes across general practice systems and therefore may not be understood or fully interoperable in consuming systems.

When considering the implementation of use cases involving allergy/intolerance consumers and their suppliers **SHALL** perform an appropriate clinical safety assessment and obtain the necessary clinical safety approvals for the processing performed by their system.

Please read [the following guidance](http://gpconnect.netlify.com/accessrecord_structured_development_allergies_guidance.html#allergyintolerance-interoperability-and-clinical-safety) for further information.

## List resource ##

The [List resource](accessrecord_structured_development_list.html) is still undergoing clinical curation and therefore guidance and examples may change while this specification is still in draft.
