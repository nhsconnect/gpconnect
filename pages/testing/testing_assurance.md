summary: "Details of what activities form the basis of GP Connect solution assurance"

Two stages of assurance activity will occur:

- Technical Accreditation
	- This is the assurance of the software/product/service that makes use of the API. 
- Solution Assurance
	- Solution assurance is carried out as part of deployment and vital to achieve a go-live with the APIs. This process ensures that the correct level of safety, governance, and security has been accepted, understood and signed off by the organisation using the APIs and data controllers of the records.


GP Connect systems are expected to undertake the following solution assurance activities before they can be deployed into a live production environment.
