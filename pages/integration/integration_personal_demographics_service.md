summary: "Overview of the role of the Personal Demographic Services (PDS) <br/>and the Spine Mini Services PDS (SMSP) within GP Connect."
---

## Personal Demographic Service (PDS) ##

GP Connect systems SHALL be capable of performing [Personal Demographic Service](http://systems.digital.nhs.uk/demographics/spineconnect){:target="_blank"} (PDS) tracing of patients to obtain their NHS Number, Date of Birth and current GP organisation.

## Spine Mini Service PDS (SMSP) ##

GP Connect systems MAY utilise the [Spine Mini Service PDS](http://systems.digital.nhs.uk/ddc/spine-mini-service){:target="_blank"} (SMSP) as a lighter weight alternative to integrating with the full Spine Personal Demographic Service (PDS).


{% include important.html content="As the SMSP service does not return multiple possible matches for the patient it is typically only suitable to be used where there is enough information to achieve a single matched trace." %}
