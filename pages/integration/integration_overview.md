The [NHS Spine Core API Framework](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/spine-core-1-0/integration_example_gpconnect.html) provides an example of the steps a consumer takes to integrate with Spine in order to use the GP Connect API. 

An overview of the different types of deployment topologies for brokering API calls through the SSP can be found at [NHS Spine Core API Framework - System Topologies](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/spine-core-1-0/ssp_system_topologies.html).
