## Structured Record Profiles are under active development ##

Structured and coded FHIR Resources are a priority for the GP Connect programme. We've been working hard to agree the content of HTML views so that we can progress to the resource modelling phase knowing that the data we want to structure is definitely available.

Workshops to model the FHIR resources for `Allergies`, `Medications`, `Problems` and `Immunisations` are the current priority with on going discussions about which use cases will be supported by the structured resources.

If you'd like to get involved or want to know more there are three options:

* We're working on setting up the next NHS Digital facilitated workshops throughout August and September to finalise the GP Connect FHIR profiles. If you believe you can add to the teams efforts please get in touch and let us know via the [GP Connect Team Inbox](mailto://gpconnect@nhs.net).
* Some early feedback on the May 2016 release of the GP Connect draft specification can be found on the [Openhealthhub Forum](https://www.openhealthhub.org/c/fhir-implementation) under the category of "FHIR Implementation". Feel free to join the discussion!
* If you're a system supplier (consumer or provider of data) within scope of GP Connect or wider healthcare you might consider looking into the [INTEROPen](http://interopen.org/) group. NHS Digital and GP Connect have representation present at INTEROPen groups and it's a good way to join an existing effort to meet the challenge of cross care setting challenge of FHIR resources.
