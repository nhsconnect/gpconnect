summary: "Use case for getting the GP Connect FHIR server's capability statement"
---

## Prerequisites ##

### Consumer ###

The consumer system:

- SHALL have previously resolved the organisation's FHIR endpoint base URL through the [Spine Directory Service](integration_spine_directory_service.html)

## API usage ##

### Request operation ###

#### FHIR relative request ####

```http
GET /metadata
```

#### FHIR absolute request ####

```http
GET https://[proxy_server]/https://[provider_server]/[fhir_base]/metadata
```

#### Request headers ####

Consumers SHALL include the following additional HTTP request headers:

| Header               | Value |
|----------------------|-------|
| `Ssp-TraceID`        | Consumer's TraceID (i.e. GUID/UUID) |
| `Ssp-From`           | Consumer's ASID |
| `Ssp-To`             | Provider's ASID |
| `Ssp-InteractionID`  | `urn:nhs:names:services:gpconnect:fhir:rest:read:metadata-1`|

#### Payload request body ####

N/A

#### Error handling ####

Provider systems are expected to always be able to return a valid capability statement.

### Request response ###

#### Response Headers ####

Provider systems are not expected to add any specific headers beyond that described in the HTTP and FHIR&reg; standards.

#### Payload response body ####

Provider systems:

- SHALL return a `200` **OK** HTTP status code on successful retrieval of the capability statement
- SHALL return a capability statement which conforms to the standard [FHIR CapabilityStatement](http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/capabilitystatement.html)

An example GP Connect CapabilityStatement is shown below ready for customisation and embedding into GP Connect assured provider systems. Providers should use this CapabilityStatement as a base for their own CapabilityStatement, replacing the element in square brackets (`[` & `]`) with specific information of their implementation. The main version at the top of the CapabilityStatement should represent the GP Connect specification version which the FHIR server implements.

```json
{% include foundations/get_capability_statement_response_example.json %}
```

Consumer systems:
- SHOULD request the capability statement from the FHIR server endpoint in order to ascertain details of the implementation of GP Connect capabilities delivered by the FHIR server
- Consumers may also cache the capability statement information retrieved from an endpoint to reduce the number of future calls they make to the target organization's FHIR server.
