## Prerequisites ##

### Consumer ###

The consumer system:

- SHALL have previously resolved the organisation's FHIR endpoint base URL through the [Spine Directory Service](integration_spine_directory_service.html)
- SHALL have previously traced the patient's NHS number using the [Personal Demographics Service]( integration_personal_demographic_service.html) or an equivalent service
- SHALL have previously [resolved the logical ID of the patient](foundations_use_case_find_a_patient.html) on the server using the NHS number

## API use case ##

This specification describes a single use cases. For complete details and background, please see the [Foundations Capability Bundle](foundations.html).

## Security ##

- GP Connect utilises TLS Mutual Authentication for system level authorization
- GP Connect utilises a JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to transmit clinical audit and provenance details

## API usage ##

### Request operation ###

#### FHIR relative request ####

```http
GET /Patient/[id]
```

#### FHIR absolute request ####

```http
GET https://[proxy_server]/https://[provider_server]/[fhir_base]/Patient/[id]
```

#### Request headers ####

Consumers SHALL include the following additional HTTP request headers:

| Header               | Value |
|----------------------|-------|
| `Ssp-TraceID`        | Consumer's TraceID (i.e. GUID/UUID) |
| `Ssp-From`           | Consumer's ASID |
| `Ssp-To`             | Provider's ASID |
| `Ssp-InteractionID`  | `urn:nhs:names:services:gpconnect:fhir:rest:read:patient-1`|

#### Payload request body ####

N/A

#### Error handling ####

Provider systems SHALL return a [GPConnect-OperationOutcome-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/GPConnect-OperationOutcome-1) resource that provides additional detail when one or more data fields are corrupt or a specific business rule/constraint is breached.

For example, the:

- logical identifier of the resource is not valid/can't be found on the server 

Refer to [Development - FHIR API Guidance - Error Handling](development_fhir_error_handling_guidance.html) for details of error codes.

### Request response ###

#### Response headers ####

Provider systems are not expected to add any specific headers beyond that described in the HTTP and FHIR&reg; standards.

#### Payload response body ####

Provider systems:

- SHALL return a `200` **OK** HTTP status code on successful execution of the operation.

- SHALL populate the following fields:

  - `nhsCommunication` with the patient's language information, where available
  - `managingOrganization` Note: this is the current organisation, as addressed by ODS code in the base URL, and NOT the patient's registered practice which may be different
