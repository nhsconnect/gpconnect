## Prerequisites ##

### Consumer ###

The consumer system:

- SHALL have previously resolved the organisation's FHIR endpoint Base URL through the [Spine Directory Service](integration_spine_directory_service.html)

## API use case ##

This specification describes a single use cases. For complete details and background please see the [Foundations Capability Bundle](foundations.html).

## Security ##

- GP Connect utilises TLS Mutual Authentication for system level authorization.
- GP Connect utilises a JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to transmit clinical audit & provenance details. 

## API usage ##

### Request operation ###

#### FHIR relative request ####

Provider systems SHALL return a [GPConnect-OperationOutcome-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/GPConnect-OperationOutcome-1) resource that provides additional detail when one or more data fields are corrupt or a specific business rule/constraint is breached.

For example, the:

- Logical identifier of the resource is not valid/can't be found on the server.
