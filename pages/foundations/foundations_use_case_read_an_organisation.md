## Prerequisites ##

### Consumer ###

The consumer system:

- SHALL have previously resolved the organisation's FHIR endpoint Base URL through the [Spine Directory Service](integration_spine_directory_service.html)
- MAY have previously [resolved the logical ID of the organisation](foundations_use_case_find_an_organisation.html) from the ODS Organisation Code.

## API use case ##

This specification describes a single use cases. For complete details and background please see the [Foundations Capability Bundle](foundations.html).

## Security ##

- GP Connect utilises TLS Mutual Authentication for system level authorization.
- GP Connect utilises a JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to transmit clinical audit & provenance details. 

## API usage ##
