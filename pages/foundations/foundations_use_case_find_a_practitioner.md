## API usage ##

Resolve (zero or more) `Practitioner` resources using a business identifier (for example, SDS User Id).

### Request operation ###

The consumer system:

- SHALL populate the `[system]` field with a valid practitioner identifier system URL (for example, `https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/sds-user-id`).

- SHALL apply percent encoding when constructing the request URL as indicated in [RFC 3986 Section 2.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.1). This will ensure that downstream servers correctly handle the pipe `|` character which must be used in the `identifier` parameter value below.

{% include important.html content="GP Connect can only guarantee a successful response for searches using the identifier type `https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/sds-user-id`. Other identifier types may result in an error response if the provider does not recognise or support the identifier." %}

#### FHIR relative request ####

```http
GET /Practitioner?identifier=[system]|[value]
```

#### FHIR absolute request ####

```http
GET https://[proxy_server]/https://[provider_server]/[fhir_base]/Practitioner?identifier=[system]|[value]
```

#### Request headers ####

Consumers SHALL include the following additional HTTP request headers:

| Header               | Value |
|----------------------|-------|
| `Ssp-TraceID`        | Consumer's TraceID (i.e. GUID/UUID) |
| `Ssp-From`           | Consumer's ASID |
| `Ssp-To`             | Provider's ASID |
| `Ssp-InteractionID`  | `urn:nhs:names:services:gpconnect:fhir:rest:search:practitioner-1`|

#### Payload request body ####

N/A

#### Error handling ####

Provider systems:

- SHALL return a [GPConnect-OperationOutcome-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/GPConnect-OperationOutcome-1) resource that provides additional detail when one or more request fields are corrupt or a specific business rule/constraint is breached

For example, the:

- Business identifier `[system]` is not recognised/supported by the provider system
- Business identifier fails any structural validation checks (for example, length and check digits)

{% include important.html content="Failure to find a record with the supplied business identifier is not considered an error condition." %}

### Request response ###

#### Response headers ####

Provider systems are not expected to add any specific headers beyond that described in the HTTP and FHIR&reg; standards.

#### Payload response body ####

Provider systems:

- SHALL return a `200` **OK** HTTP status code on successful execution of the operation.
- SHALL return zero or more matching `Practitioner` resources in a `Bundle` of `type` searchset.
- SHALL return `Practitioner` resources that conform to the [CareConnect-GPC-Practitioner-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-GPC-Practitioner-1) profile.

- SHALL populate the following `Practitioner` fields:
  - `meta.profile` with the profile URI
  - `versionId` with the current version of each `Practitioner` resource
  - `identifier` with relevant business identifiers (for example, SDS User Id) for each `Practitioner` resource
  - `name`
  - `gender` where available
  - `nhsCommunication` with the practitioner's language information, where available

- SHALL meet [General FHIR resource population requirements](development_fhir_resource_guidance.html#general-fhir-resource-population-requirements) populating all fields where data is available, excluding those listed below

- SHALL NOT populate the following fields:
  - `telecom`
  - `address`
  - `birthDate`
  - `photo`
  - `qualification`
