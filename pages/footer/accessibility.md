## Downloading documents

Downloadable documents on this site are provided in a variety of formats. The most common are PDF, Word, Excel and Zip.

### Software for document reading

Most computers already have the software to open these document formats. If you do not have Adobe Acrobat Reader (for reading PDFs), it is available from the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/">Adobe website</a>. If you do not have Winzip (for opening zip files), you can download a free trial from the <a href="http://www.winzip.com/index.htm">Winzip website</a>.

### Saving documents to your computer

If you have a PC, right-click on the link to the document. If you use an Apple Mac, hold down the mouse button over the link. In both cases, a popup menu will then appear. Scroll down the menu and click on 'Save target as'. You will then be asked to choose a folder on your computer where you can save the document.

Assistive technologies such as screen readers may have their own specific way to save documents, please refer to your preferred software's Help section.
