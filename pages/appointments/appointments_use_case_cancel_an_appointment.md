## Use Case ##

The typical flow to cancel an appointment is:

 1.	Search by `NHS Number` for, or otherwise obtain, a `Patient` resource.
 2. Search for `Appointment` resources for the `Patient` resource.
 3. Choose an `Appointment` resource and cancel it by amending the `status` to `cancelled`.

## Security ##

- GP Connect utilises TLS Mutual Authentication for system level authorization.
- GP Connect utilises a JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to transmit clinical audit & provenance details. 

## Prerequisites ##

### Consumer ###

The Consumer system:

- SHALL have previously traced the patient's NHS Number using PDS or an equivalent service.
- SHALL have previously found the appointment id using Retrieve a patient's appointments.

## API Usage ##

### Request Operation ###

#### FHIR Relative Request ####

```http
PUT /Appointment/[id]
```

#### FHIR Absolute Request ####

```http
PUT https://[proxy_server]/https://[provider_server]/[fhir_base]/Appointment/[id]
```

#### Request Headers ####

Consumers SHALL include the following additional HTTP request headers:

| Header               | Value |
|----------------------|-------|
| `SSP-TraceID`        | Consumer's TraceID (i.e. GUID/UUID) |
| `SSP-From`           | Consumer's ASID |
| `SSP-To`             | Provider's ASID |
| `SSP-InteractionID`  | `urn:nhs:names:services:gpconnect:fhir:rest:update:appointment` |

#### Payload Request Body ####

The request payload is a profiled version of the standard FHIR [Appointment](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/appointment.html) resource.

Only the following data-elements can be modified when performing an appointment cancellation.

- the appointment `status` MUST be updated to "cancelled".
- the appointment `cancellation-reason` extension SHALL be included with the cancellation reason details.

{% include important.html content="If any content other than the appointment reason is updated the server SHALL reject the amendment and return an error." %}

On the wire a JSON serialised request would look something like the following:

```json
{
	"resourceType": "Appointment",
	"id": "1",
	"meta": {
		"versionId": "636068818095315079",

	}]
}
```

#### Error Handling ####

The Provider system SHALL return an error if:

- any appointment details other than the appointment `status` and `cancellation-reason` fields are attempted to be updated.

Provider systems SHALL return an [OperationOutcome](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/operationoutcome.html) resource that provides additional detail when one or more data fields are corrupt or a specific business rule/constraint is breached.

Refer to [Development - FHIR API Guidance - Error Handling](development_fhir_error_handling_guidance.html) for details of error codes.

### Request Response ###

#### Response Headers ####

Provider systems are not expected to add any specific headers beyond that described in the HTTP and FHIR&reg; standards.

#### Payload Response Body ####

Provider systems:

- SHALL return a `200` **OK** HTTP status code on successful execution of the operation.
- SHALL return an `Appointment` resource that conform to the `gpconnect-appointment-1` profile.
- SHALL include the relevant GP Connect `StructureDefinition` profile details in the `meta` fields of the returned response.
- SHALL include the `versionId` of the current version of each `Appointment` resource.
- SHALL have updated the appointment `status` to cancelled.
- SHALL have updated the appointment `cancellation-reason` inline with any details supplied in the request.
