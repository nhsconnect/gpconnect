## Search for free slots ##

<i class='fa fa-check'/> As a Healthcare Professional at a HealthCare Organisation I would like to be able to access all available appointments at an organisation so that a Patient can be directed to appropriate care.

> 1. Appointments/Admin Hub – A Patient needs to see a GP quickly and her own GP has no available slots.  Calls are diverted to the  Hub, where the team have access to extended hours appointments.  These hubs serve a number of practices and their patients and allow for the sharing of the additional workload across the membership.
> 2. Overflow Cover - Overflow telephone cover - federated phone service which can redirect calls from small practice with only 1 receptionist, to larger practice with 4 receptionists, at busy times of the day, to avoid patients getting the engaged tone, or not being answered.  Access required to Appointments for all participating practices.
> 3. Evening services (for example, Phlebotomy, Physio) - bookable across the federation, so all practices need to be able to access the appointments book.

<i class='fa fa-check'/> As a GP Practice Manager, I would like to be able to manage and control access to the Practice's available appointments so that ultimately patients have access to the right appointment according to their requirement.

<i class='fa fa-check'/> As an Urgent Care Service Manager, I would like to have confidence that appointment slots agreed with GP Practices to be designated for the use of Urgent Care are not made available to other organisations so that our patients have access to the right appointment according to their requirement


## Retrieve a patient's appointments ##

<i class='fa fa-check'/> As a healthcare professional at a healthcare organisation I would like to view for a patient their future appointments so that I can arrange their care appropriately.

> 1. As a clinician, being able to view all booked and scheduled GP appointments and visits enables me to ensure that I am not duplicating visits, creating appointments or schedules that clash with other appointments or over burden my patient by arranging for multiple appointments or visits within too short a period of time.
> 2. As a clinician, having a view of all booked and scheduled GP appointments and visits for my patient means that I could arrange a joint visit with other healthcare professionals if appropriate in order to reduce the number of separate visits my patient has.

<i class='fa fa-road'/> When receiving a new referral for a community team, the team will review other healthcare professionals that are providing care to the patient and look at the schedule of visits being provided by any other teams in order that they don’t arrange visits in a schedule that might clash with other visits or over-burden the patient.

<i class='fa fa-road'/> As a patient I would like to view all my future appointments with any care organization so that I can arrange my time accordingly.

<i class='fa fa-road'/>  As a member of the discharge support team in the hospital, I want to book an appointment for my patient with the district nurse for the removal of sutures the week after discharge.

<i class='fa fa-road'/> As a healthcare professional at a healthcare organisation I would like to book an appointment for a registered patient with a pharmacy so that I can manage their care appropriately.

A nurse realises that an appointment that has been made for a patient does not highlight that the patient is a wheelchair user and will require to be seen in a room in the surgery on the ground floor. The nurse is able to update the appointment with this information so that the patient can be accommodated for their appointment.

## Cancel appointment ##

<i class='fa fa-check'/>As a healthcare professional at a healthcare organisation I would like to cancel a patient's appointment on their behalf so that missed appointments are reduced and appointment lists are kept up to date and accurate.

> 1. A patient realises that she isn’t going to be able to make her GP appointment the next morning, but it is already 6pm. Previously there would have been no way of letting the surgery know, but now she can call the surgery because there is someone on the phone at the local admin hub from 7am until 8pm who can cancel her appointment via their system, thus freeing it up for someone else to book.

<i class='fa fa-check'/> As a healthcare professional at a healthcare organisation, I would like to cancel an appointment made by another healthcare organisation so that the patient can be seen at the earliest or more convenient time, and the original appointment made available for re-booking.
