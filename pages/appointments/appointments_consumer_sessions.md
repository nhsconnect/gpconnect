The Appointment Management consumer application makes use of individual API calls described in 'API use cases' to perform business processes. 

## Consumer session - booking an appointment ##

The sequence diagram below illustrates which individual API calls are required by a consumer to book an appointment at a GP practice in the simplest case. It describes interactions of the consumer with the provider FHIR endpoint at the practice, and does not include details of the prerequisite interactions with Spine services. See [Spine integration illustrated](integration_illustrated.html) for details of an end-to-end appointment booking scenario with Spine service interactions included.

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1a   | **Consumer** makes an API call to [Search for free slots](appointments_use_case_search_for_free_slots.html) at the practice in the specified timeframe. |
| 1b   | **Provider** responds with details of what slots are available for booking. Should no applicable slots be returned, the consumer may make repeated calls to [Search for free slots](appointments_use_case_search_for_free_slots.html) with amended date ranges. |
|      |      |
| 2a   | **Consumer** then makes API call to [Find a patient](foundations_use_case_find_a_patient.html) providing the patient's NHS Number. |
| 2b   | **Provider** finds patient record and returns the logical identifier of the patient record at this practice in their system. See [Patient record not present](appointments_consumer_sessions.html#consumer-session---booking-an-appointment---no-patient-record) for an illustration of the steps required in this case. |
|      |      |
| 3a   | **Consumer** calls [Book an appointment](appointments_use_case_book_an_appointment.html) indicating the slots selected in the UI together with the logical ID of the patient. |
| 3b   | **Provider** responds with details of the booked appointment as confirmation of success. |


## Consumer session - booking an appointment at a collection of federating practices ##

Where a consumer user interface provides a view of available bookings across a collection of federating practices, some steps are repeated for each practice, as shown below:
