## Use case ##

This API is used to amend the `description` or `comment` fields of a patient's future appointment, obtained via either the [Retrieve a patient's appointments](appointments_use_case_retrieve_a_patients_appointments.html), or [Read an appointment](appointments_use_case_read_an_appointment.html) APIs.

Any future appointment irrespective of booking organisation, and irrespective of whether the appointment was booked via the GP Connect API, can be amended by a consuming organisation participating with the appointment hosting organisation in a GP Connect deployment.

The typical flow to amend an appointment is:

 1. Search by NHS number for, or otherwise obtain, a `Patient` resource.
 2. Search for `Appointment` resources for the `Patient` resource.
 3. Choose an `Appointment` resource and update `description` and/or `comment` fields.

Amending a cancelled appointment is NOT supported.

{% include important.html content="The Appointment Management capability pack is aimed at administration of a patient's appointments. As a result of information governance (IG) requirements, the amend appointments capability has been restricted to future appointments. More details are available on the [Design decisions](appointments_design.html#viewing-and-amending-booked-appointments) page." %}

## Security ##

- GP Connect utilises TLS Mutual Authentication for system level authorization
- GP Connect utilises a JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to transmit clinical audit and provenance details

## Prerequisites ##

### Consumer ###

The consumer system:

- SHALL have previously resolved the organisation's FHIR endpoint base URL through the [Spine Directory Service](integration_spine_directory_service.html)
- SHALL have previously traced the patient's NHS Number using the [Personal Demographics Service]( integration_personal_demographic_service.html) or an equivalent service
- SHALL have previously found the appointment ID using [Retrieve a patient's appointments](appointments_use_case_retrieve_a_patients_appointments.html)

## API usage ##

The consumer system SHALL only use the amend appointment capability to amend:

- `description` or `comment` fields.  Providers SHALL return an error when any other field is amended.
- future appointments where appointment start date/time is after the current date/time. If the appointment start date/time is in the past the provider SHALL return an error.
- appointments that have not been cancelled.  Providers SHALL return an error where an amendment to a cancelled appointment is received.

### Request operation ###

#### FHIR relative request ####

```http
PUT /Appointment/[id]
```

#### FHIR absolute request ####

```http
PUT https://[proxy_server]/https://[provider_server]/[fhir_base]/Appointment/[id]
```

#### Request headers ####

Consumers SHALL include the following additional HTTP request headers:

| Header              | Value                                                                                                               |

| `Ssp-TraceID`       | Consumer's TraceID (i.e. GUID/UUID)                                                                                 |
| `Ssp-From`          | Consumer's ASID                                                                                                     |
| `Ssp-To`            | Provider's ASID                                                                                                     |
| `Ssp-InteractionID` | `urn:nhs:names:services:gpconnect:fhir:rest:update:appointment-1`                                                   |
| `If-Match`          | The Appointment's current [ETag](development_general_api_guidance.html#managing-resource-contention), e.g. `W/"23"` |

#### Payload request body ####

The request payload is a profiled version of the standard FHIR [Appointment](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/STU3/appointment.html) resource. See [FHIR resources](/datalibraryappointment.html) page for more detail.

Consumer systems:

- SHALL send an `Appointment` resource that conforms to the [GPConnect-Appointment-1](https://simplifier.net/guide/gpconnect-data-model/Home/FHIR-Assets/All-assets/Profiles/Profile--GPConnect-Appointment-1?version=current) profile.
- SHALL include the URI of the `GPConnect-Appointment-1` profile StructureDefinition in the `Appointment.meta.profile` element of the appointment resource.
- SHALL NOT amend an appointment with a status of `cancelled`

Only the following data elements can be modified when performing an appointment amendment:

- `description` containing a brief description of the appointment.
  - Consumers SHALL impose a character limit of 100 characters for this element.
  - This element SHALL only contain limited information to support the appointment and SHALL NOT be used for "transfer of care" clinical information.
- `comment` containing 'patient specific notes' and any additional comments relating to the appointment.
  - Consumers SHALL impose a character limit of 500 characters for this element.
  - This element SHALL only contain limited information to support the appointment and SHALL NOT be used for "transfer of care" clinical information.

{% include important.html content="It is recommended that Consumers read the Appointment they wish to amend (via Read an appointment or Retrieve a patient's appointments), then update the fields allowed below in place. Attempting to recreate the Appointment resource from local transformed data formats/structures is not advised, and may result in the provider system rejecting the amendment due to an unintended change or missing field." %}

#### Provider handling of description and comment ####

When receiving `description` and `comment` fields in the provider system:

- Providers systems SHALL store information received in `description` and `comment` fields, supporting the character limit lengths shown above
- Providers systems SHALL NOT truncate information received in `description` or `comment` fields
- Providers SHALL return `description` and `comment` fields to the consumer in the response payload, as stored
- Where a consumer sends information longer than character limits supported, an error SHALL be returned to the consumer
- Where there are not two suitable appointment text fields in a provider system, providers MAY concatenate `description` and `comment` (with suitable delimiters) in order to store in a single field, such that data is not lost

#### Example request body ####

On the wire, a JSON serialised request would look something like the following:

```json
{% include appointments/amend_appt_request_example.json %}
```

#### Error handling ####

The provider system:

- SHALL return a [GPConnect-OperationOutcome-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/GPConnect-OperationOutcome-1) resource that provides additional detail when one or more request fields are corrupt or a specific business rule/constraint is breached.
- SHALL return an error where:
  - any appointment details other than the appointment `comment` or `description` are amended. The appointment resource should be considered invalid and the provider system should return a `422` error with error code `INVALID_RESOURCE`.
  - the appointment being amended is in the past (the appointment start dateTime is before the current date and time).
  - the appointment has been cancelled.  Provider systems should return a `422` error with error code `INVALID_RESOURCE`.
  - the version identifier in the `If-Match` header does not match the Appointment's current version identifier.  See [Managing resource contention](development_general_api_guidance.html#managing-resource-contention).
  - the `description` or `comment` fields contain more characters than can be stored in the provider system

Refer to [Development - FHIR API guidance - error handling](development_fhir_error_handling_guidance.html) for details of error codes.
