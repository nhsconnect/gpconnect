## Use case ##

This specification describes a single use case enabling the consumer to request from the targeted provider system slots matching the selected date range, booking organisation ODS Code and Type, and other parameters including UC Disposition Code and Service ID. 

Refer to [Consumer sessions illustrated](appointments_consumer_sessions.html) for how this API use case could be used in the context of a typical consumer appointment management session.

## Security ##

- GP Connect utilises TLS Mutual Authentication for system level authorization
- GP Connect utilises a JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to transmit clinical audit and provenance details

## Search parameters ##

Provider systems SHALL support the following search parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Paths |
|---|---|---|---|
| `status` | `token` | The free/busy status of the appointment | `Slot.status` |
| `start` | `date` or `dateTime` | Slot start date, or date and time | `Slot.start` |
| `end` | `date` or `dateTime` | Slot end date, or date and time | `Slot.end` |
| `searchFilter` | `token` | A generic token to allow consumers to pass additional search criteria to the provider. | (n/a) |

{% include note.html content="The supported search parameters should be included in the [FHIR Capability Statement](foundations_use_case_get_the_fhir_capability_statement.html)." %}

## _include parameters ##

Provider systems SHALL support the following include parameters:

| Name | Description | Paths |
|---|---|---|
| `_include=Slot:schedule` | Include `Schedule` resources referenced within the returned `Slot` Resources | `Slot.schedule` |
| `_include:recurse= Schedule:actor:Practitioner` | Include `Practitioner` resources referenced within the returned `Schedule` resources | `Schedule.actor:Practitioner` |
| `_include:recurse= Schedule:actor:Location` | Include `Location` resources referenced within the returned `Schedule` resources | `Schedule.actor:Location` |
| `_include:recurse= Location:managingOrganization` | Include `Organization` resources references from matching `Location` resources | `Location.managingOrganization` |

Consumer systems SHALL send the following parameters in the request:

- The `start` parameter SHALL only be included once in the request.
- The `start` parameter SHALL be supplied with the `ge` search prefix. For example, `start=ge2017-09-22`, which indicates that the consumer would like slots where the slot start date is on or after "2017-09-22".
- The `end` parameter SHALL only be included once in the request.
- The `end` parameter SHALL be supplied with the `le` search prefix. For example, `end=le2017-09-26`, which indicates that the consumer would like slots where the slot end date is on or before "2017-09-26".
 
  ![Diagram - Date range parameters](images/appointments/SearchForFreeSlots.png)

- The `start` and `end` parameters SHALL contain a search prefix as specified above, and:
  - either, a `date` in the format `yyyy-mm-dd`. Partial dates are not allowed.
  - or, a `dateTime` in the format `yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss+hh:mm` in (UK) local time, with the timezone offset `+00:00` for UTC and `+01:00` for BST.

- `status=free` specifies that only free slots will be returned. Note: the slot status value of `free` SHALL be specified, other slot status values are not permitted.

- `_include=Slot:schedule` specifies that associated `Schedule` resources are returned.

Consumer systems SHOULD send the following parameters in the request:

- `searchFilter` parameters - see [Enhanced slot filtering](#enhanced-slot-filtering).

Consumer systems MAY send the following *_include* parameters in the request, to minimise the number of API calls required to prepare an appointment booking:

- `_include:recurse=Schedule:actor:Practitioner`
- `_include:recurse=Schedule:actor:Location`
- `_include:recurse=Location:managingOrganization`

{% include note.html content="Search for free slots does not prevent searching for slots in the past, but all other appointment management capabilities do not allow for appointment management where the appointments start date element is in the past. Therefore, slots found in the past cannot be used to book an appointment." %}

### Enhanced slot filtering ###

{% include important.html content="It is recognized that provider systems must offer GP practices more functionality to enable them to better manage their available appointment slots in the light of increasing access requirements from other organisations. GP Connect has specified additional provider requirements to enable this. These additional requirements are outlined on the [Slot availability management](appointments_slotavailabilitymanagement.html) page" %}

In order for providers to return the appropriate slots for the consumer, the consumer SHOULD send in the following parameters using the `searchFilter` parameter using the [token](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/STU3/search.html#token) parameter format of `system|code`:

| Parameter name | Parameter value - system element | Parameter value - code element |
| --- | --- |
| `searchFilter` | `https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/ods-organization-code` | Consumer ODS organisation code, e.g. `A11111`|
| `searchFilter` | `https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/CodeSystem/GPConnect-OrganisationType-1` | Consumer organisation type code from [GPConnect-OrganisationType-1 valueset](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/CodeSystem/GPConnect-OrganisationType-1), e.g. `urgent-care` |

Where search filters are sent by consumers which are not explicitly supported in this specification (for example, urgent care use a disposition code value set), providers who do not understand the additional parameters SHALL ignore them and SHALL NOT return an error.

## Search for free slots on the wire ##

On the wire, a search for free slots request sending all parameters, and searching on date, would look something like the following:

```http
GET /Slot?status=free&start=ge2017-10-20&end=le2017-10-31&_include=Slot:schedule&_include:recurse=Schedule:actor:Practitioner&_include:recurse=Schedule:actor:Location&_include:recurse=Location:managingOrganization&searchFilter=https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/CodeSystem/GPConnect-OrganisationType-1|gp-practice&searchFilter=https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/ods-organization-code|A1001
```

A search for free slots request sending only mandatory and required parameters, and searching on date and time, would look something like the following:

```http
GET /Slot?status=free&start=ge2019-03-29T12:00:00+00:00&end=le2019-04-01T17:00:00+01:00&_include=Slot:schedule&searchFilter=https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/CodeSystem/GPConnect-OrganisationType-1|gp-practice&searchFilter=https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/ods-organization-code|A1001
```

## Booking multiple adjacent slots ##

Please see the conditions in which a consumer may book multiple adjacent slots on the [Book an appointment](appointments_use_case_book_an_appointment.html#booking-multiple-adjacent-slots) page.

## Consumer display requirements ##

The fields below allow a patient to choose and attend an appointment appropriate to their needs.

In order to prevent incorrect or unsuitable bookings, and to allow a patient to attend the appointment at the correct time, place or via the correct delivery channel, consumer systems SHALL support the following fields: 

- Start date and time
- End date and time, or duration
- Delivery channel (in-person, telephone, video)
- Slot type and schedule type (see `Slot.serviceType` and `Schedule.serviceCategory`)
- Location name and address
- Practitioner role (e.g. General Medical Practitioner, Nurse)
- Practitioner name and gender

## Prerequisites ##

### Consumer ###

The consumer system:

- SHALL have previously resolved the organisation's FHIR endpoint base URL through the [Spine Directory Service](integration_spine_directory_service.html)
- SHALL request a maximum date range covering a two-week period

{% include tip.html content="Multiple separate API calls can be made if a larger date range is required. However, consideration should be given to the load this placed on the provider system." %}
