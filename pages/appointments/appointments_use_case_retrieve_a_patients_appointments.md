## Use Case ##

This specification describes a single use cases. For complete details and background please see the [Appointment Management Capability Bundle](appointments.html).

## Security ##

- GP Connect utilises TLS Mutual Authentication for system level authorization.
- GP Connect utilises a JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to transmit clinical audit & provenance details. 

## Prerequisites ##

### Consumer ###

The Consumer system:

- SHALL have previously resolved the organisation's FHIR endpoint Base URL through the [Spine Directory Service](https://nhsconnect.github.io/gpconnect/integration_spine_directory_service.html)
- SHALL have previously traced the patient's NHS Number using the [Personal Demographics Service]( https://nhsconnect.github.io/gpconnect/integration_personal_demographic_service.html) or an equivalent service.
- SHALL have previously [resolved the logical ID of the patient](https://nhsconnect.github.io/gpconnect/foundations_use_case_find_a_patient.html) on the server using the NHS Number

## API Usage ##

### Request Operation ###

#### FHIR Relative Request ####

```http
GET /Patient/[id]/Appointment
```

Providers SHALL support searching within this compartment by `start` date/time, for example:

```http
GET /Patient/[id]/Appointment?start=[{search_prefix}start_date]{&start=[{search_prefix}end_date]}
```

The Provider systems:

- SHALL support the following search prefixes (lt,le,gt,ge,ne) as outlined in the [Development Guidance - FHIR API Guidance - Common API Guidance](development_fhir_api_guidance.html) section.  

#### FHIR Absolute Request ####

```http
GET https://[proxy_server]/https://[provider_server]/[fhir_base]/Patient/[id]/Appointment
```

Providers SHALL support searching within this compartment by `start` date/time, for example:

```http
GET https://[proxy_server]/https://[provider_server]/[fhir_base]/Patient/[id]/Appointment?start=[{search_prefix}start_date]{&start=[{search_prefix}end_date]}
```

#### Request Headers ####

Consumers SHALL include the following additional HTTP request headers:

| Header               | Value |
|----------------------|-------|
| `Ssp-TraceID`        | Consumer's TraceID (i.e. GUID/UUID) |
| `Ssp-From`           | Consumer's ASID |
| `Ssp-To`             | Provider's ASID |
| `Ssp-InteractionID`  | `urn:nhs:names:services:gpconnect:fhir:rest:search:patient_appointments` |

#### Payload Request Body ####

N/A

#### Error Handling ####

Provider systems:

- SHALL return an [OperationOutcome](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/operationoutcome.html) resource that provides additional detail when one or more request fields are corrupt or a specific business rule/constraint is breached.

Refer to [Development - FHIR API Guidance - Error Handling](development_fhir_error_handling_guidance.html) for details of error codes.

For example:

- Where the use of the `start` search parameter does not define a valid date range, HTTP Status code 422 with error code 'INVALID_PARAMETER' will be returned.


### Request Response ###

#### Response Headers ####

Provider systems are not expected to add any specific headers beyond that described in the HTTP and FHIR&reg; standards.

#### Payload Response Body ####

Provider systems:

- SHALL return a `200` **OK** HTTP status code on successful execution of the operation.
- SHALL include the relevant GP Connect `StructureDefinition` profile details in the `meta` fields of the returned response.
