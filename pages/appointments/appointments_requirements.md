The GP Connect requirements documentation for the Appointment Management Capability contains the set of business and solution requirements as defined in the API specifications and FHIR Structure Definitions. These are to be regarded as authoritative where difference, contradiction, or inaccuracy is identified in the requirements documentation.

The requirements and resulting API design have been developed in collaboration with NHS England, the GP Principal System Suppliers, clinical and GP Practice administrative stakeholders, FoT CCGs, and NHS Digital Urgent Care teams.

## User stories, API requirements & use cases ##
The business requirements are described as a set of high-level user stories with corrresponding functional specification requirements. System use case descriptions and activity diagrams detail how the Capability APIs are used for booking an appointment, or amending/cancelling an appointment.

## Physical data model ##
The physical data model identifies and defines the FHIR profile data items populated by Provider and/or Consumer as part of the Appointment Management APIs. 


## Requirements Documentation ##
