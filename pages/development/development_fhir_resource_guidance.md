GP Connect has specified profiled versions of the international [Fhir Resources](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/){:target="_blank"}, tailoring them to meet the requirements of the GP Connect use cases and to aid in interoperability between systems.

The profiled Fhir Resources required for each of the GP Connect capability packs are specified within the specific specification sections for each of the capabilities:

* [Foundations](datalibraryfoundation.html)
* [Access Record HTML](datalibraryaccessRecord.html)
* [Access Record Structured](accessrecord_structured.html)
* [Appointment Management](appointments.html)
