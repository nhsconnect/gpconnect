## Purpose ##

This document is intended for use by software developers looking to build a conformant GP Connect API interface utilising the FHIR&reg; standard.

### Notational Conventions ###

The keywords "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

## FHIR Implementation Guidance ##

The purpose of the implementation guide is to describe adaptations of the base FHIR specification specific for GP Connect First of Type (FoT) implementations. It therefore focuses mainly on any additional constraints and specialisations from the base specification that apply to GP Connect. The complete specification therefore comprises the base FHIR specification plus the constraints and specialisations described herein. Where there is a conflict between the base specification and this document, this document shall take precedence.

### [FHIR Overview](http://hl7.org/fhir/overview-dev.html) ###

As outlined on the official [HL7&reg; FHIR](http://hl7.org/fhir/) website:

> FHIR (Fast Health Interoperability Resources) is designed to enable information exchange to support the provision of healthcare in a wide variety of settings. The specification builds on and adapts modern, widely used RESTful practices to enable the provision of integrated healthcare across a wide range of teams and organizations.

### [FHIR Timelines](http://hl7.org/fhir/timelines.html) ###

{% include note.html content="This document is written to accompany the currently released version of FHIR which is **Draft Standard For Trial Use (DSTU) 2**." %}

FHIR is currently a draft standard and as such is expected to evolve and develop over time. As such the NHS Digital expects FHIR clients and servers (developed as part of GP Connect) to be maintained and uplifted to newer versions of the FHIR&reg; standard as they become available and are staged into the GP Connect programme.

A pre-release version of FHIR (expected to be the basis of STU3) has been published as the [May 2016](http://hl7.org/fhir/2016May/) release. The FHIR community is expecting the finalised STU3 release to be made available in late 2016/early 2017.

When a new release of the FHIR standard has been published for use NHS Digital will carry out an impact assessment of all FHIR resources used by the GP Connect API project to determine the impact of transitioning to the new FHIR release. Following this assessment, the FHIR Resource library will be updated to include resources using this new release. NHS Digital will work with Consumers and Providers throughout this transition phase and are expected to maintain both versions of the FHIR release until it has been agreed that the old version can be deprecated.

<p/>

{% include note.html content="[STU3](http://hl7.org/fhir/2016May/) includes the introduction of a new draft `Task` resource which may impact the future implementation direction of the GP Connect Task profile." %}

### [FHIR Implementations](http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Open_Source_FHIR_implementations) ###

The Health Level Seven (HL7&reg;) International standards body maintains a list of open source FHIR implementations on their [Wiki](http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Open_Source_FHIR_implementations). Currently five FHIR server implementations and a number of client libraries are available as open source software. These are written in a variety of popular programming languages (e.g. Java, C#.NET, JavaScript and Python).

{% include tip.html content="NHS Digital recommends software vendors consider utilising (and contributing back to) an existing open source FHIR library to both help accelerate development and to grow/mature the open source FHIR ecosystem." %}

### FHIR In Scope ###

{% include warning.html content="Vendors are free to implement additional FHIR functionality above that mandated under the GP Connect delivery if they so desire. However, the Spine Security Proxy (SSP) will only forward accredited system interactions." %}

### Maturity Roadmap ###

At a high-level the maturity roadmap of a compliant Principal GP system is expected to follow the following FHIR and business capability maturity stages.

Refer to [Design - Design Principles - Maturity Model](designprinciples_maturity_model.html) for full details.

### Internet Standards ###

Clients and servers SHALL be conformant to the following Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Request for Comments (RFCs) which are the principal technical standards that underpin the design and development of the internet and thus FHIR's APIs.

- Transport level integration SHALL be via HTTP as defined in [RFC 2616](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616).
- Transport level security SHALL be via TLS/HTTPS as defined in [RFC 5246](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246) and [RFC 6176](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6176).
- HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) as defined in [RFC 6797](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797) SHALL be employed to protect against protocol downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking.

{% include roadmap.html content="The NHS Digital is currently evaluating how [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/) (CORS) will be handled for web and mobile based applications." %}

### Endpoint Resolution ###

Clients SHALL perform a sequence of query operations against existing Spine services to enable FHIR endpoint resolution.

1. Clients SHALL perform (or have previously performed) a PDS lookup for a patient.
	1. Using the PDS results the client SHALL determine the patient's primary GP organisation. 
2. Clients SHALL perform (or have previously performed) a SDS lookup using the ODS code of the patient's primary GP organisation.
	1. Using the SDS results the client SHALL determine the Principal GP system responsible for hosting the most up to date GP care record.
		1. [EMIS Health](http://www.emishealth.com/)
		2. [INPS](http://www.inps.co.uk/)
		3. [Micotest](http://www.microtest.co.uk/)
		4. [TPP](http://www.tpp-uk.com/)
2. Clients SHALL construct a [FHIR Service Root URL](#ServiceRootURL) suitable for access to a GP vendor's FHIR server. For GP Connect access to the Principal GP systems will be via the [Spine Security Proxy](#SpineSecurityProxy) and as such the URL will need to be pre-pended with a Proxy Service Root URL.

{% include tip.html content="Where a practitioner (with a valid SDS User ID) or organisation (with a valid ODS Code) record already exists with-in the local system the details associated with these existing records may be used for display purposes." %}

### [Security](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/security.html) ###

TLS SHALL be used for all data exchange. The TLS communications are established prior to any HTTP command/response, so the whole FHIR interaction is protected by the TLS communications.

The security of the endpoints of the TLS communications must be risk-managed, so as to prevent inappropriate risks (e.g. audit logging of the GET parameters into an unprotected audit log).

#### [Authentication](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/security.html#authentication) ####

The FHIR&reg; standard specifies that users/clients/servers may be authenticated in any way desired. However, for web-centric use, oAuth ([RFC 6749](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749)) is recommended but not mandated by the FHIR&reg; standard.

For the purpose of GP Connect FoT clients and servers SHALL authenticate using TLS Mutual Authentication (MA) utilising client certificates provided by the NHS Digital for this purpose.

### [System Conformance](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/conformance.html) ###

Servers SHALL provide a read-only FHIR Conformance resource that identifies all of the profiles and operations that the server supports for each resource type.

A servers conformance statement SHALL be available using the following [conformance interactions](http://hl7.org/fhir/http.html#conformance):

```
GET [base]/metadata {?_format=[mime-type]}
```

Refer to [Foundations - Get The FHIR Conformance Profile](foundations_use_case_get_the_fhir_conformance_profile.html) for an example GP Connect FHIR conformance profile.

{% include roadmap.html content="NHS Digital is evaluating the benefits of providing a centrally hosted FHIR server to act as a definition repository for *Content* and *Operation Control* [Infrastructure Resources](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/infrastructure.html). However, this is out of scope for the initial GP Connect deployments." %}

### [Resource Conformance](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/profiling.html#2.13.0.3.2) ###

To help a consumer find the correct set of reports for a use-case, a provider of resources SHALL, for any profile declared in `Conformance.profile` mark resources with profile assertions documenting the profile(s) they conform to. A provider of resources SHOULD also ensure that any resource instance that would reasonably be expected to conform to the declared profiles SHOULD be published in this form.

#### GP Connect API Conformance ####

GP Connect comprises a number of RESTful API bundles. Each API bundle is intended to support sets of related use cases, for example the Appointment API bundle supports viewing, booking and cancelling GP appointments in a number of scenarios.

Individual API bundles may be provided independently of each other. GP Connect conformance may be claimed in relation to one or more API bundles. A provider claiming to provide an API bundle must be fully conformant (i.e. implement all of the resource profiles and interactions for the API bundle as specified in this document and all of the general requirements described herein).

## [RESTful API](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/http.html) ##

The RESTful API described in the FHIR&reg; standard is built on top of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) with the same HTTP verbs (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.) commonly used by web browsers. Furthermore, FHIR exposes resources (and operations) as Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs). For example, a `Patient` resource `/fhir/Patient/1`, can be operated upon using standard HTTP verbs such as `DELETE /fhir/Patient/1` to remove the patient record.

The FHIR RESTful API Style Guide defines the following URL conventions which are used throughout the remainder of this document:

- URL pattern content surrounded by **[ ]** are mandatory.
- URL pattern content surrounded by **{ }** are optional.

### [Service Root URL](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#general) ###

The Service Root URL is the address where all of the resources defined by this interface are found. The Service Root URL takes the form of:

```
https://server{/path}
```

The Service Root URL is the `[base]` portion of all FHIR APIs.

{% include important.html content="All URLs (and ids that form part of the URL) defined by this specification are case sensitive." %}

<p/>

Discussions are ongoing around the use of [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) in the server's Service Root URL to provide a clear distinction between API versions that are incompatible (i.e. contain breaking changes) vs. backwards-compatible (i.e. contain no breaking changes).

Whilst consumer systems are required to construct a Service Root URL that is suitable for interacting with the SSP service, API provider systems will be unaware of any additional URL prefix as this will be removed prior to calling the final API endpoint.

### [Resource URL](http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/http.html#2.1.0) ###

	VERB [base]/[type]/[id] {?_format=[mime-type]}

Clients and servers constructing URLs SHALL conform to [RFC 3986 Section 6 Appendix A](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#appendix-A) which requires percent-encoding for a number of characters that occasionally appear in the URLs (mainly in search parameters).

### [HTTP Verbs](http://hl7.org/fhir/valueset-http-verb.html) ###

The following HTTP verbs SHALL be supported to allow RESTful API interactions with the various FHIR resources:

- **GET**
- **POST**
- **PUT**
- **DELETE**

{% include tip.html content="Please see later sections for which HTTP verbs are expected to be available for which FHIR resources." %}

<p/>

{% include roadmap.html content="In a future version of the FHIR&reg; standard it is expected that the **PATCH** verb will also be supported." %}

#### [Resource Type](http://hl7.org/fhir/resourcelist.html) ####

GP Connect provider systems SHALL support FHIR resource types as profiled within the [GP Connect FHIR Resource Definitions](http://developer.nhs.uk/downloads-data/fhir-resource-definitions-library/). 

#### [Resource ID](http://hl7.org/fhir/resource.html#id) ####

This is the `logical Id` of the resource which is assigned by the server responsible for storing it. The logical identity is unique within the space of all resources of the same type on the same server, is case sensitive and can be up to 64 characters long.

Once assigned, the identity SHALL never change. `logical Ids` are always opaque, and external systems need not and should not attempt to determine their internal structure.

{% include important.html content="As stated above and in the FHIR&reg; standard, `logical Ids` are opaque and other systems should not attempt to determine their structure (or rely on this structure for performing interactions). Furthermore, as they are assigned by each server responsible for storing a resource they are usually implementation specific. For, example: NoSQL document stores typically preferring a GUID key (e.g. 0b28be67-dfce-4bb3-a6df-0d0c7b5ab4) whilst Relational Database stores typically preferring a integer key (e.g. 2345)." %}   

#### External Resource Resolution ####

Inline with work being undertaken in other jurisdictions (see the [Argonaut Implementation Guide](http://argonautwiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Implementation_Guide) for details) GP Connect provider systems are not expected to resolve full URLs that are external to their environment.

### [Content Types](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#mime-type) ###

Servers SHALL support both formal MIME-types for FHIR resources:

- XML: `application/xml+fhir`
- JSON: `application/json+fhir`

Servers SHALL support the optional `_format` parameter in order to allow the client to specify the response format by its MIME-type. If both are present, the `_format` parameter overrides the `Accept` header value in the request.

### [Transfer Encoding](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#mime-type) ###

Clients and servers SHALL support the HTTP `Transfer-Encoding` header with a value of `chunked`. This indicates that the body of a HTTP response will returned as an unspecified number of data chunks (without an explicit `Content-Length` header).

### Content Compression ###

To improve system performances clients/servers SHALL support GZIP compression.

Compression is requested by setting the `Accept-Encoding` header to `gzip`.

{% include tip.html content="Applying content compression is key to reducing bandwidth needs and improving battery life for mobile devices." %} 

### HTTP Headers ###

#### Proxying Headers ####

Additional HTTP headers SHALL be added into the HTTP request/response for the purpose of allowing the proxy system to disclose information lost in the proxying process (e.g. the originating IP address of a request). Typically, this information is added to proxy forwarding headers as defined in [RFC 7239](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7239).

#### Cross Organisation Provenance & Audit Headers ####

In order to meet auditing and provenance requirements (which are expected to be closely aligned with the IM1 requirements), clients SHALL provide an oAuth 2.0 Bearer token in the HTTP Authentication header (as outlined in [RFC 6749](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749)) in the form of a JSON Web Token (JWT) as defined in [RFC 7519](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519).

{% include tip.html content="We are using an open standard (i.e. JWT) to bundling together the provenance and audit data for ease of transport between the consumer and provider systems. It is important to note that these tokens (for GP Connect FoT) will not be centrally issued and are not signed or encrypted (i.e. are constructed of plain-text). Furthermore, there are JWT libraries available for most programming languages and they are simple to use." %}

Refer to [Integration - Cross Organisation Audit & Provenance](integration_cross_organisation_audit_and_provenance) for full details of the JWT claims that SHALL be used for passing audit and provenance details between systems.

{% include important.html content="We have defined a small number of additional headers which are also required to be included in NHS Digital defined custom headers." %}

Clients SHALL add the following Spine proxy headers for audit and security purposes:

- `Ssp-TraceID` - TraceID (generated per request) which identifiers the sender's message/interaction (i.e. a GUID/UUID).
- `Ssp-From` - ASID which identifies the sender's FHIR endpoint.
- `Ssp-To` - ASID which identifies the recipient's FHIR endpoint.
- `Ssp-InteractionID` - identifies the FHIR interaction that is being performed.<sup>1</sup>

<sup>1</sup> please refer to the [Development - FHIR API Guidance - Operation Guidance](development_fhir_operation_guidance.html) for full details.

The Spine Security Proxy (SSP) SHALL perform the following checks to authenticate client request:

- Get the CN from the TLS session and compare the host name to the declared endpoint.
- Check that the client/sending endpoint has been registered (and accredited) to initiate the given interaction.
- Check that the server/receiving endpoint has been registered (and accredited) to receive/process the given interaction.   

### [Managing Return Content](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#return) ###

Severs SHALL default to the `return=representation` behaviour (i.e. returning the entire resource) for interactions that create or update resources.

Servers SHOULD honour a `return=minimal` or `return=representation` preference indicated in the `Prefer` request header, if present.

### [Managing Resource Contention](http://hl7.org/fhir/http.html#concurrency) ###

Servers SHALL always return an `ETag` header with each resource including the resources `versionId`:

```http
HTTP 200 OK
Date: Sat, 09 Feb 2013 16:09:50 GMT
Last-Modified: Sat, 02 Feb 2013 12:02:47 GMT
ETag: W/"23"
Content-Type: application/json+fhir
```

`ETag` headers which denote resource `version Id`s SHALL be prefixed with `W/` and enclosed in quotes, for example:

```http
ETag: W/"3141"
```

Clients SHALL submit update requests with an `If-Match` header that quotes the `ETag` from the server.

```http
PUT /Patient/347 HTTP/1.1
If-Match: W/"23"
```

If the `version Id` given in the `If-Match` header does not match, the server returns a `409` **Conflict** status code instead of updating the resource.

For server's that don't persist historical versions of a resource (i.e. any resource other than the currently available/latest version) then they SHALL operate in-line with the guidance provided in the following [Hay on FHIR - FHIR versioning with a non-version capable back-end](https://fhirblog.com/2013/11/21/fhir-versioning-with-a-non-version-capable-back-end/) blog post. This is to ensure that GP Connect servers will be compatible with version-aware clients, even though the server itself doesn't support the retrieval of historical versions.

### [Managing Return Errors](http://hl7.org/fhir/http.html#2.1.0.4) ###

FHIR defines an [OperationOutcome](http://hl7.org/fhir/operationoutcome.html) resource that can be used to convey specific detailed processable error information. An `OperationOutcome` may be returned with any HTTP `4xx` or `5xx` response, but is not always required.

## FHIR Resources ##

### [Resource Narrative](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/narrative.html) ###

The FHIR resource narrative is not currently expected to be populated. 

### [Resource References](http://hl7.org/fhir/references.html) ###

The FHIR resource model includes references from one resource to another.

A reference can be either:

- a relative or absolute URL to a resource managed by the same resource server (a local reference), or 
- an absolute URL to a resource managed by another resource server (a remote reference)

A provider’s ability to process a request relating to a resource may depend on its ability to use one or more resource references that the resource contains (i.e. its ability to ‘follow the links’ to other resources).

{% include important.html content="GP Connect clients and servers SHALL utilise local relative references only and as such the resources will be expected to reside on the same server." %}

Resource references SHALL include a short human-readable `display` field for identification of the resource that is being referenced which can be used for display purposes without needing to pull the entire referenced resource.

| Resource | Display Format |
| -------- | -------------- |
| `Patient` | patient.name (patient.identifier) |
| `Practitioner` | practitioner.name (practitioner.identifier) |
| `Organization` | organization.name (organisation.identifier) |

{% include todo.html content="Further display field guidance to be added in [Stage 2.](designprinciples_maturity_model.html)" %}

### [Resource Metadata](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/resource.html#Meta) ###

Servers SHALL provide the `profile` metadata for each item, asserting that the content conforms to one of the GP Connect resource profiles.

Servers SHALL provide the `version Id` metadata for each item. This SHALL change each time the content of the resource changes.

Clients SHALL utilise the `version Id` when performing updates to allow [management of resource contention](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#concurrency) and to protect against [Lost Updates](http://www.w3.org/1999/04/Editing/).

### [Resource Transactions](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#transactional-integrity) ###

When performing an update or create interaction, servers:

-	SHALL **validate the content against valid profiles** and business rules before creating/updating the resource.
-	MAY apply business rules that alter the content.
-	MAY merge updated content with existing content.

Servers SHALL validate the existence of any referenced resources when creating or updating a resource. For example, a `Slot` reference (e.g. `Slot/D497DB00-99AA-11E5-A837-0800200C9A66`) used when creating a new `Appointment` would be checked for existence on the server and an error returned (and the create interaction aborted) if the slot does not exist.

Refer to the GitHub hosted [GP Connect FHIR Repository](https://github.com/nhsconnect/gpconnect-fhir) for the published FHIR profiles.

Refer to the [HL7&reg; FHIR&reg; Validator](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/validation.html#jar) page for the most upto date details on how FHIR resources can be validated. 

Servers SHALL provide a read interaction for every resource it accepts update interactions on.

Consumers SHALL follow the pattern described in the [Transactional Integrity](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#transactional-integrity) section of the base FHIR specification, built on top of version-aware updates, for updating resources.

## FHIR Resource Interactions ##

### Requests ###

Servers SHALL be able to consume and process the following requests for GP Connect FoT.

#### Response Codes ####

Servers SHALL produce the following main [HTTP Status Codes](http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xhtml). 

| HTTP Status Code | Description |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| `200` | OK |
| `201` | Created |
| `400` | Bad Request |
| `401` | Unauthorized |
| `403` | Forbidden |
| `404` | Not Found |
| `405` | Method Not Allowed |
| `409` | Conflict |
| `410` | Gone |
| `412` | Precondition Failed |
| `422` | Unprocessable Entity |
| `500` | Internal Server Error |

#### [Rejecting Updates](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#2.1.0.10.1) ####

[OperationOutcome](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/operationoutcome.html) may be returned with any HTTP `4xx` or `5xx` response, but is not required - many of these errors may be generated by generic server frameworks underlying a FHIR server.

Servers are permitted to reject update interactions because of integrity concerns or other business rules, and return HTTP status codes accordingly (usually a `422`).

As outlined in the FHIR specification, any of these errors SHOULD be accompanied by an [OperationOutcome](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/operationoutcome.html) resource that provides additional detail concerning the issue.

Refer to [FHIR Guidance - Error Handling](development_fhir_error_handling_guidance.html) for full details of error codes that SHALL be used when returning an operation outcome error.

### [Compartment Based Access](http://hl7.org/fhir/compartments.html) ###

```
VERB [base]/[compartment_type]/[id]/[type]{?_format=[mime-type]}
```

Each resource type may belong to one or more logical compartments. A compartment is a logical grouping of resources which share a common property.

Servers SHALL support the `Patient` compartment for `Appointment` access.

The patient compartment includes any resources where the `subject` of the resource is the patient.

For example, to retrieve a list of all of a patient's appointments, use the URL:

```http
GET [base]/Patient/[id]/Appointment
```

Servers SHALL support searching within this compartment by `start` and `end` date/time, for example:

```http
GET [base]/Patient/[id]/Appointment?start=[{search_prefix}start_date]{&start=[{search_prefix}end_date]}
```

Example:

## [Read Resource](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#read) ##

```http
GET [base]/[type]/[id]{?_format=[mime-type]}
```

The returned resource SHALL have an `id` element with a value that is the [id].

Servers SHALL return an `ETag` header with the `version Id` of the resource.

### Available for Resources ###

| Capability   | Resource(s) |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| **Foundations**     | `Patient`, `Practitioner`, `Organization` |
| **Access Record**   | TBC |

### Retrieving a patient resource by logical Id ###

#### Request ####

```http
GET [base]/Patient/[id]
```

For example:

```http
GET [base]/Patient/1A6E1B1C-6340-4663-926C-9CD1306EAAF8?_format=application/xml+fhir
```

{% include tip.html content="In this example the response format has been specified in the request URL using the `_format` parameter. This could also have been specified using the HTTP Accept Header mechanism." %} 

#### Response ####

## [Create Resource](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#create) ##

To create a new resource a RESTful **POST** operation with a request body SHALL be utilised.   

```http
POST [base]/[resourcetype]
```

When the server creates a new resource and returns a `201` **Created** HTTP status code, it SHALL also return a `Location` header which contains the new `logical Id` and `version Id` of the created resource.

```http
Location: [base]/[type]/[id]/_history/[vid]
```

[id] and [vid] are the newly created `logical Id` and `version Id` for the resource version. An `ETag` header with the `version Id` and a `Last-Modified` header will also be included in the response.

### Available for Resources ###

| Capability   | Resource(s) |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| **Foundations**   | &nbsp; |
| **Access Record** | &nbsp; |
| **Appointments**  | `Appointment` |
| **Tasks**         | `Order` |

{% include important.html content="In workshop discussions with all Principal GP system vendors it has been agreed that record locking (inside the GP CIS) will not impact on the ability of clients to query the GP Connect APIs and obtain the latest saved patient data." %}

### Create Example: Book an appointment for a patient ###

#### Request ####

```http
POST [base]/Appointment
```

*Request Body*

```xml
<Appointment>
</Appointment>
```

#### Response ####

```xml
<Appointment>
</Appointment>
```

## [Update Resource](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#update) ##

To update an existing resource, a RESTful **PUT** operation with a request body SHALL be utilised.

```http
PUT [base]/[resourcetype]/[id]
```

| Capability       | Resource(s) | Field(s) |
| ------------ | ----------- | -------- |
| **Foundations**   | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| **Access Record** | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| **Appointments**  | `Appointment` | reason |
| **Tasks**         | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |

### Update Example: Modify the appointment reason for a patient as their condition has changed ###

#### Request ####

```http
PUT [base]/Appointment/2A6FFB1C-5540-1613-926C-7DD1306EBBF8
```

*Request Body*

```xml
<Appointment>
</Appointment>
```

#### Response ####

```xml
<Appointment>
</Appointment>
```

## [Delete Resource](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#delete) ##

To delete an existing resource, a RESTful **DELETE** operation with no request body SHALL be utilised.

```http
DELETE [base]/[resourcetype]/[id]
```

| Capability   | Resource(s) |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| **Foundations**   | &nbsp; |
| **Access Record** | &nbsp; |
| **Appointments**  | &nbsp; |
| **Tasks**         | &nbsp; |

{% include important.html content="GP Connect clients and servers are currently not expected to utilise the ability to delete a resource using the RESTful DELETE operation. However, this section is included as implementers should ensure that their implementation choices don't preclude the use of this HTTP verb in future release." %}

## [Operations](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/operations.html) ##

Operations are used (a) where the server needs to play an active role in formulating the content of the response, not merely return existing information, or (b) where the intended purpose is to cause side effects such as the modification of existing resources, or creation of new resources.

As outlined in the [Extend and Restricting the API](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/profiling.html#api) section of the FHIR&reg; standard, the NHS Digital has decided to prefix it's operation names with a short prefix (e.g. `gpc`) followed by a "." to reduce the likelihood of name conflicts.

## [Search Resources](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#search) ##

A simple search is executed by performing a `GET` request optionally accompanied by zero or more name-value URL encoded parameters:

```http
GET [base]/[resourcetype]?name=value&...
```

In order to enable searching by date/time range, servers SHALL support the following prefixes as defined in the base FHIR specification for date parameters: eq, gt, lt, ge, le.

To search for all the appointments for a patient that occurred over a 2 year period:

```http
GET [base]/Patient/1A6E1B1C-6340-4663-926C-9CD1306EAAF8/Appointment?start=ge2014-01-01&start=le2015-12-31
```

### [Chained Parameters](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/search.html#2.1.1.4.13) ###

Servers SHALL support searching by a chained `Patient` identifier parameter for references to `Patient` resources that conform to the `GP-Patient` profile (and therefore have an NHS Number identifier). For example:

```http
GET [base]/AllergyIntolerance?patient.identifier=http://fhir.nhs.net/Id/nhs-number|1234569876
```

{% include important.html content="GP Connect clients and servers are not expected to support arbitrary adhoc searching." %}

### Search Example: Search for a patient resource by business Id ###

#### Request ####

```http
GET [base]/Patient?identifier=http://fhir.nhs.net/Id/nhs-number|9900002831 
```

If a Patient resource for NHS number 9900002831 exists then the server SHALL return a Bundle containing all Patient resources with the specified NHS number identifier.

#### Response ####

```xml
<Bundle>
	<Patient xmlns="http://hl7.org/fhir">
		<id value="1A6E1B1C-6340-4663-926C-9CD1306EAAF8" />
		<meta>
			<profile value="http://fhir.nhs.net/StructureDefinition/gpconnect-patient-1" />
		</meta>
		<identifier>
			<system value="http://fhir.nhs.net/Id/nhs-number" />
			<value value="9900002831" />
		</identifier>
		<name>
			<use value="usual" />
			<family value="Smith" />
			<given value="Mike" />
			<prefix value="Mr" />
		</name>
		<birthDate value="1977-01-09" />
		<address>
			<use value="home" />
			<type value="both" />
			<line value="2, The Green" />
			<city value="Harrogate" />
			<district value="Yorkshire" />
			<postalCode value="HG1 4AF" />
		</address>
	</Patient>
</Bundle>
```

### [Advanced Search](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/search.html#query) ###

Servers SHALL implement the `_query` search parameter to enable custom named search profiles to be defined and used which describe a specific query operation.

```http
GET [base]/[resourcetype]?_query=[query_name]&name=value&...
```

Servers SHOULD implement the standard search equivalent of the advanced custom named search for queries defined under the GP Connect FoT.

#### Request ####

```http
GET [base]/Schedule?_query=getschedule&date=ge2016-05-12&date=le2016-05-26
```

#### Response ####

```xml
<Bundle xmlns="http://hl7.org/fhir">
	 <type value="searchset"/>
</Bundle>
```
