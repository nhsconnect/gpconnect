## Try the online demonstrator ##

> View the latest build of the [GP Connect Demonstrator](https://orange.testlab.nhs.uk/demonstrator-v0.html){:target="_blank"} online now!

{% include tip.html content="Data held in the GP Connect Demonstrator is reset each night to allow for easier testing. Please refer to the Demonstrator's in-built help for further details." %}

## Objective ##

Take the [Ripple](https://ripple.foundation/){:target="_blank"} open source record viewer and use it to demonstrate the GP Connect APIs to validate and accelerate delivery of the GP Connect APIs. The demonstrator acts as a mock Consuming application to show how the data made available by the APIs could be used. 

## Current status ##

We now have a functioning user interface that can drive interactions with the FHIR-based APIs to implement the following capabilities:

- Access Record HTML
- Appointment Management

## System architecture ##
