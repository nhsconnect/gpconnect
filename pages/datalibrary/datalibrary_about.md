# GP Connect - FHIR API - Get Care Record Operation #

## About ##

### Background ###

The GP Connect project aims to improve general interoperability; opening up information and data held within GP Practice IT systems through the implementation of standards-based integration, supported by a simplified operating model.

It will integrate GP IT with the wider market by improving access to clinical and administrative data across other health and social care settings, meet evolving Patient Facing Services requirements, support federated working in GP IT and look to improve the current IM1 service. In doing this it will allow provision of increased levels of patient care and allow open market access for subsidiary suppliers, leading to reduced costs and shorter time-to-market for new capabilities.

### Further Information ###

This specification is based on and is intended to be used alongside the published HL7&reg; [FHIR&reg; DSTU2](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/){:target="_blank"} specification.
