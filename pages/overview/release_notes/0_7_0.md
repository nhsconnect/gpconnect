## Introduction ##

A full internal review following early FoT feedback has been carried out on the 0.5.0 specification. The resulting 0.7.0 specification has been rewritten to ensure any potential clinical safety issues have been addressed, and missing information has been supplied. It has also been aligned more generally with specification releases across the other GP Connect capabilities.

The 0.7.0 release contains a major change against the Medications view, a reordering of the Summary page content, the introduction of CSS IDs and classes, plus some general specification uplifts and improvements.

Please see below for further details.


## 0.7.0 changes ##

### S-Flag patients to return Patient Not Found in ARHTML ###

**Tickets**:&nbsp; [#528](https://github.com/nhsconnect/gpconnect/issues/528)

**Affects:**&nbsp; Access Record HTML

**Description:**

- version 0.5.0 of ARHTML HTML implementation standards states that demographic details are to be redacted for patients which are S-flagged on Spine e.g. 'May be redacted if patient is flagged on Spine as Sensitive demographics.' This has been queried and subsequently changed in other capabilities for providers not to return patient records for S-flagged patients but to return a 'Patient Not Found' error.

**Pages changed:**

- [Standards](accessrecord_development_html_implementation_guide.html#demographic-cross-checking)
  - a requirement for a 'patient not found' error message to be returned has been added

**Tickets**:&nbsp; [#114](https://github.com/nhsconnect/gpconnect/issues/114)

**Affects:**&nbsp; Access Record HTML

**Description:**

- the scenario where only a start or an end date need to be considered and the GP Connect program needs to update the specification to cater for the possibility of someone only sending a start date or an end date

**Pages changed:**

- [Layout](accessrecord_development_html_layout_guide.html#date-banner)

### Medications Prescribed Elsewhere ###

**Tickets**:&nbsp; [#523](https://github.com/nhsconnect/gpconnect/issues/523)

**Affects:**&nbsp; Access Record HTML

**Description:**

- the inclusion of a Medications Prescribed Elsewhere (MPE) was considered to be out of scope for HTML View 0.5.x specification releases. Further investigation and clinical engagement has indicated that there is a significant need for this information in the HTML View.

**Pages changed:**

- [Medications](accessrecord_view_medications.html)
  - requirement added to include medications prescribed elsewhere in the Medications HTML view
  
---

### Medication Issues ###

**Tickets**:&nbsp; [#524](https://github.com/nhsconnect/gpconnect/issues/524)

**Affects:**&nbsp; Access Record HTML

**Description:**

- there is a usability issue within the “Current Medication Issues” section. Specifically the handling of multiple entries for repeat medications (every issue is itemised)
	
	there is also the issue of the repeat medication entries and acute medication entries being bundled together, which makes it difficult for a clinician to review

	feedback from FoT has highlighted that large amounts of data in the Current Medication Issues subsection of the Summary section reduces its effectiveness as a quick overview and risks subsequent subsections being overlooked

**Pages changed:**

- [Medications](accessrecord_view_medications.html)
  - the Medications page has been completed transformed in 0.7.0. following clinical review/sign-off
  - Current Medication Issues has been replaced by Recent Acute Medications
  - The following list of subsections now comprises the Medication view:
	- Recent Acute Medication
	- Current Repeat Medication
	- Discontinued Repeat Medication
	- All Medication (Summary)
	- All Medication Issues
	
---

### Reason for discontinued and cancelled medication ###

**Tickets**:&nbsp; [#531](https://github.com/nhsconnect/gpconnect/issues/531)

**Affects:**&nbsp; Access Record HTML

**Description:**

- it is extremely important for the details regarding the ending of a medication to be available to a clinician, as this will highlight any clinical issues (e.g. stopping a medication due to an allergy etc.) and allow the clinician to make an efficient and informed clinical decision.   Specification 0.5.x only requires a cancelled/discontinued and date to be included in the Details column. The reason is not specified as required.   “Where the medication was cancelled (Acute) or Discontinued (Repeat), this should be included in the Details column as Cancelled followed by Date of Cancellation or Discontinued, followed by Date when discontinued.

**Pages changed:**

- [Medications](accessrecord_view_medications.html)
  - the Medications page has been completed transformed in 0.7.0. following clinical review/sign-off
  - requirements for discontinued an cancelled reason have been added, where applicable
  
---

### Current is not explicitly defined for medication subsection content ###

**Tickets**:&nbsp; [#532](https://github.com/nhsconnect/gpconnect/issues/532)

**Affects:**&nbsp; Access Record HTML

**Description:**

- it is imperative that the application of rules for the placement and transition of individual medication item entries within the 3 sub sections is clearly understood and any mitigating text is appropriately provided.

	currently this is not the case, therefore a clinician will get differing views depending on the supplier providing the data (and potentially the specific GP Practice where a local configuration setting can determine the age for ‘current’) and there is no text explaining the differences.

**Pages changed:**

- [Medications](accessrecord_view_medications.html)
  - the Medications page has been completed transformed in 0.7.0. following clinical review/sign-off
  - each subsection now contains greater detail as to what is being displayed
  
---

### Separate the dosage information from the medications details columns ###

**Tickets**:&nbsp; [#533](https://github.com/nhsconnect/gpconnect/issues/533)

**Affects:**&nbsp; Access Record HTML

**Description:**

- clinician feedback has highlighted that it would be useful to have a separate dosage column across all of the medications sub sections. The information is currently available within the text about the medication item, making this a usability issue.   The availability of a separate dosage column makes it easier or a clinician to ‘compute’ and make clinical assessments and decisions.

**Pages changed:**

- [Medications](accessrecord_view_medications.html)
  - separate `Dosage Instruction` and `Quantity` columns have been provided following clinical feedback/sign-off
  
---

### Add a definition for the application of decimal places for numeric value ###

**Tickets**:&nbsp; [#534](https://github.com/nhsconnect/gpconnect/issues/534)

**Affects:**&nbsp; Access Record HTML

**Description:**

- First of Type feedback has noted that some values are presented to a number of decimal places which could misrepresent the accuracy of recording or make it less user friendly to read the values, for example, in the Observations section

**Pages changed:**

- [Standards](accessrecord_development_html_implementation_guide.html)
  - section added to the Implementation Standards page to add CUI reference to Medication Representation documentation
  
---

### Summary page - reordering of sections ###

**Tickets**:&nbsp; [#542](https://github.com/nhsconnect/gpconnect/issues/542)

**Affects:**&nbsp; Access Record HTML

**Description:**

- First of Type feedback has noted that the first 3 encounters should be the first subsection on the Summary page

**Pages changed:**

- [Summary](accessrecord_view_summary.html)
  - New layout of Summary page based on FoT feedback and Medications updates:
	- Last 3 Encounters
	- Active Problems and Issues
	- Current Allergies and Adverse Reactions
	- Recent Acute Medication
	- Current Repeat Medication

### Add section for CSS styling ###

**Tickets**:&nbsp; [#546](https://github.com/nhsconnect/gpconnect/issues/546)

**Affects:**&nbsp; Access Record HTML

---

### Standards and Layout requirements ###

**Tickets**:&nbsp; [#610](https://github.com/nhsconnect/gpconnect/issues/610)

**Affects:**&nbsp; Access Record HTML
