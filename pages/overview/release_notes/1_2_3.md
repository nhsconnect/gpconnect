### Don't populate Bundle.entry.fullUrl ###

**Tickets**:&nbsp; [#605](https://github.com/nhsconnect/gpconnect/issues/605), [#633](https://github.com/nhsconnect/gpconnect/issues/633)

**Affects:**&nbsp; Foundations, Appointment Management, Access Record Structured

**Description:**

- After discussion with suppliers, it has been decided that `Bundle.entry.fullUrl` shall not be populated for all our capabilities.  The reasoning behind this is as follows:
  - Lack of use cases for GP Connect consumers
  - Inconsistency in population - requires an absolute URL and therefore not able to populate for resources that don't have [read](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/STU3/http.html#read) endpoint (e.g. AllergyIntolerance, MedicationStatement, Slot, Schedule)

- [FHIR resource guidance](development_fhir_resource_guidance.html#bundleentryfullurl)
