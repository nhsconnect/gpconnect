## Introduction ##

*Please note:* Some changes affect more than one capability - please see the **Affects** label for a full list of changed capabilities.

## 1.2.3 changes ##

## Core ##

### Don't use Bundle.entry.fullUrl ###

**Tickets**:&nbsp; [#605](https://github.com/nhsconnect/gpconnect/issues/605), [#633](https://github.com/nhsconnect/gpconnect/issues/633)

**Affects:**&nbsp; Foundations, Appointment Management, Access Record Structured

**Description:**

- After discussion with suppliers, it has been decided that `Bundle.entry.fullUrl` should not be populated for Foundations and Appointments, and must not be populated for Access Record Structured.  The reasoning behind this is as follows:
  - Lack of use case for GP Connect consumers
  - Inconsistency in ability to populate - requires an absolute URL and therefore not able to populate for resources that don't have [read](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/STU3/http.html#read) endpoint (e.g. AllergyIntolerance, MedicationStatement, Slot, Schedule)
- Consumers must not use this element.

**Pages changed:**

- [FHIR resource guidance](development_fhir_resource_guidance.html#bundleentryfullurl)
  - Added cross capability Bundle.entry.fullUrl requirement

- [Access Record Structured - Bundle](accessrecord_structured_development_bundle.html#entryfullurl)
  - Added Bundle.entry.fullUrl to do not populate list

- [Allergies examples](accessrecord_structured_development_fhir_examples_allergies.html)
- [Medication examples](accessrecord_structured_development_fhir_examples_medication.html)
- [Search for free slots](appointments_use_case_search_for_free_slots.html#payload-response-body)
- [Retrieve a patient's appointments](appointments_use_case_retrieve_a_patients_appointments.html#payload-response-body)

### Minimise likelihood of rejected tokens due to clock skew ###

**Tickets**:&nbsp; [#640](https://github.com/nhsconnect/gpconnect/issues/640)

**Affects:**&nbsp; Core

**Description:**

- When determining validity of the JWT token, clock skew between consumer and provider may cause a token to be rejected.

- The following addition has been made:

  - Providers and consumers must synchronise their system clocks with NTP time servers

- The following related clause has been added as was not previously explicitly stated:

  - Providers must reject tokens that have expired (validate the `exp` element)

- Please note: `iat` should not be validated by providers

**Pages changed:**

- [Cross organisation audit and provenance](integration_cross_organisation_audit_and_provenance.html#exp-expiry-claim)

### Clarify ASID requirements and topologies for "aggregators" ###

**Tickets**:&nbsp; [#616](https://github.com/nhsconnect/gpconnect/issues/616)

**Affects:**&nbsp; Core

**Description:**

- Clarify that GP Connect consumer systems must have a unique ASID per organisation using the consumer system
- Where GP Connect consumer applications are hosted or provisioned by another organisation, the ASID sent in the `Ssp-From` header, and the `requesting_organization` resource sent in the JWT must reflect the organisation from where the request originated, rather than the hosting organisation

**Pages changed:**

- [System topologies](integration_system_topologies.html)
- [Spine Secure Proxy](integration_spine_secure_proxy.html#http-headers)
- [Cross organisation audit and provenance](integration_cross_organisation_audit_and_provenance.html#requesting_organization-claim)

### SDS query changes to support multiple consumers at a site ###

**Tickets**:&nbsp; [#638](https://github.com/nhsconnect/gpconnect/issues/638)

**Affects:**&nbsp; Core

**Description:**

- Update SDS queries used by a consumer to locate a provider's FHIR service root URL

  - Instead of quering the AS record first, query the MHS record first

  - Only provider systems hold GP Connect interaction IDs on their MHS record, this enables the new queries to return the providers endpoint deterministically

- Adding information where a consumer system wants to lookup it's own ASID

- Please see the new queries on [Overview and querying SDS](integration_spine_directory_service.html) for more information

**Pages changed:**

- [Overview and querying SDS](integration_spine_directory_service.html)
  - Rewrite and change of queries
- [Spine integration illustrated](integration_illustrated.html)
  - Change order of SDS queries
- [Registering systems in SDS](integration_sds_registering_endpoints.html)
  - Expand information to include requirement for consumer system registration

### Consumer shall not amend the Provider service root URL as retrieved from SDS ###

**Tickets**:&nbsp; [#652](https://github.com/nhsconnect/gpconnect/issues/652)

**Affects:**&nbsp; Core

**Description:**

- When a consumer systems construct a full URL to be sent to the SSP, they must not amend any part of the provider service root URL, except for prefixing with the SSP URL, and suffixing with the FHIR request path

- The following examples will cause the SSP to reject the request:
  - Changing the provider's hostname to an IP address
  - Adding an explicit `:443` port declaration where none exists in SDS

**Pages changed:**

- [Overview and querying SDS](integration_spine_directory_service.html#step-3-consumer-constructs-full-gp-connect-request-url-to-be-sent-to-the-spine-security-proxy)
