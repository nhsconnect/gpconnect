## 1.1.1 changes ##

### Core specification

- [FHIR API guidance](development_fhir_api_guidance.html)
  - Changed guidance around the "display" field on "Reference" elements within resources to align with what providers have implement and what has been tested.

- [Security guidance](development_api_security_guidance.html)
  - Changed security requirements as the protocols "TLS v1.0" and "v1.1" have been deprecated. Ciphers "AES256+SHA" and "AES128+SHA" have also been deprecated. Requirements now say to use TLS 1.2 and the remaining allowed ciphers.
  
### Appointment Management

- [Appointment Management FHIR resources](datalibraryappointment.html)
  - Added a diagram to show the links between resources used within the appointment management capability.
