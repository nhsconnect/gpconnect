### Realign requirements for date handling in html implementation guidance ###

**Tickets**:&nbsp; [#632](https://github.com/nhsconnect/gpconnect/issues/632)

**Affects:**&nbsp; Access Record HTML

**Description:**

The HTML implementation guidance layout page covers the requirements for date filtering and standards for date banners. The content has been added to and is set within the requirements for the layout and descriptions of standard banners. The date filtering is not specifically about the layout.
The flow of the details about the layout and standard banners may be improved by moving the date filtering details outside of the banners section. The clarity of the rules regarding date filters and default dates may be clearer if presented together in its own section with banner content covered separately.


**Pages changed:**
- [Layout](accessrecord_development_html_layout_guide.html)
  - Date filter content moved out of date banner section
