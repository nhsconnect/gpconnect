#### Updates to Population of the codeable concept

**Tickets:**&nbsp;

**Affects:**&nbsp; Access Record Structured

**Impacts:** Provider and Consumer systems

**Description:**

- The codable concept is a fundamental data type in the FHIR specification. In the UK we have extended this data type so that it is able to carry the SNOMED ConceptId **AND** DescriptionId. Extending in this way means there are a number of ways that these fields could be populated. This document describes in detail how this data type **MUST** be populated in the UK.
Following a change of approach in the SNOMED for primary care project the way in which this is specified has changed significantly. All consumer and provider suppliers need to read the updated guidance in full and ensure they thoroughly understand the different scenarios that can occur and are documented here.

- [FHIR resources overview](accessrecord_structured_development_resources_overview.html)
- [Guidance on the population of CodeableConcept](pages/accessrecord_structured/GuidanceOnCodeableConcept.pdf)
