### Register patient flow fails when patient is active but not PDS traced ###

**Tickets:**&nbsp; [#921](https://github.com/nhsconnect/gpconnect/issues/921)

**Affects:**&nbsp; Appointment Management

**Impacts:** Provider systems, Consumer systems

**Description:**

The Find Patient/Register Patient flow can fail where an active patient's NHS number has not been verified (via a PDS trace or cross check, or via NHAIS tracing):

1. Consumer system calls Find Patient.
2. Provider system matches an active patient record, but which has not been PDS traced, and so returns an empty bundle.
3. Consumer system receives the empty bundle, and so calls Register Patient.
4. Provider system receives the Register Patient call, starts registration process, finds an active patient and so returns a DUPLICATE_REJECTED error.
5. Consumer cannot continue to book an appointment for this patient.

In order to prevent the above flow from failing, where a Find Patient call matches an active patient record who's NHS number has not been verified, the provider system should now attempt to verify the patient's NHS number on PDS.

**Pages changed:**

- [Find a patient](foundations_use_case_find_a_patient.html)
