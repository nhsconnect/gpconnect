### Register patient flow fails when patient is active but not PDS traced ###

**Tickets:**&nbsp; [#921](https://github.com/nhsconnect/gpconnect/issues/921)

**Affects:**&nbsp; Foundations

**Impacts:** Provider systems, Consumer systems

**Description:**

The Find Patient/Register Patient flow can fail where an active patient's NHS number has not been verified (via a PDS trace or cross check, or via NHAIS tracing):

1. Consumer system calls Find Patient.
2. Provider system matches an active patient record, but which has not been PDS traced, and so returns an empty bundle.
3. Consumer system receives the empty bundle, and so calls Register Patient.
4. Provider system receives the Register Patient call, starts registration process, finds an active patient and so returns a DUPLICATE_REJECTED error.
5. Consumer cannot continue to book an appointment for this patient.

In order to prevent the above flow from failing, where a Find Patient call matches an active patient record with an NHS number that has not been verified, the provider system shall now attempt to verify the patient's NHS number on PDS.

{% include important.html content="This issue was detected in an 'extended hours hub' organisation where PDS tracing was enabled some time after the organisation had opened and consequently a number of active patients had never been PDS traced or synchronised.  It is not expected this logic will be frequently used in GP practices since PDS is generally well established and most if not all patients will have been traced on PDS (or indirectly via NHAIS)." %}

**Pages changed:**

- [Find a patient](foundations_use_case_find_a_patient.html#provider-system-unverified-record-requirements)
  - Add provider system unverified record requirements
