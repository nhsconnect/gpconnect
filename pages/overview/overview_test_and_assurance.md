Both consumer and provider APIs need to go through a set of testing and assurance processes to ensure they are robust enough to meet the demands of busy NHS organisations. You will need to provide evidence that all tests have been completed â€“ see the provider testing and consumer testing pages for further information:

- discover the [test resources](testing_deliverables.html) that support the holistic testing of consumer applications
- see which [environments](testing_environments.html) are available to support the technical accreditation and solution assurance process
- read about the [consumer testing](testing_api_consumer_testing.html) process
- read about the [provider testing](testing_api_provider_testing.html) process
