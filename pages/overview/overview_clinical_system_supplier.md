Follow this pathway if you're a GP clinical data supplier,such as EMIS Health, INPS Vision,  Microtest Health, TPP, and you want to use GP Connect to develop a way of allowing other systems to access GP data on your system for direct patient care:

- read about the GP Connect [priority capabilities](overview_priority_capabilities.html).
- look through the design decisions made so far in relation to each capability pack ([Foundations](foundations_design.html), [Access Record HTML](accessrecord.html), [Access Record Structured](accessrecord_structured_design.html) and [Appointment Management](appointments_design.html) and get involved:
	- <span class="label label-success">SELECTED</span> / <span class="label label-info">DECISION</span> A decision has been made for first release.
	- <span class="label label-warning">ASSUMPTION</span> An assumption has been made which is under review/needs validated.

Our developer ecosystem takes you through each stage of a typical GP Connect API project:
