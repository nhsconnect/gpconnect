You may be working with an end user organisation to solve their business needs or developing an application to secure a place in the healthcare market. Whatever your reason for developing, this specification shows you how to connect to the GP Connect APIs and get your product ready for use.

Our developer ecosystem diagram gives you an overview of a consumer supplier journey for a typical GP Connect API project. Click on the stages to find out more.

## Introductory topics ##

- read about the GP Connect [capabilities](overview_priority_capabilities.html)
- look through the design decisions made so far in relation to each capability ([Foundations](foundations_design.html), [Access Record Structured](accessrecord_structured_design.html) and [Appointment Management](appointments_design.html)) and get involved:
	- <span class="label label-success">SELECTED</span> / <span class="label label-info">DECISION</span> a decision has been made for first release.
	- <span class="label label-warning">ASSUMPTION</span> an assumption has been made which is under review/needs validated
- read the GP Connect [FHIR&reg; API guidance](development_fhir_api_guidance.html) common to all APIs

## Integration with Spine ##

Consumer suppliers can develop applications that use GP Connect specifications to consume GP data. To retrieve data from a provider supplier, your application will need to integrate with the [Spine](overview_spine_integration.html). This will involve using the Personal Demographics Service (PDS) and Spine Secure Proxy (SSP).
