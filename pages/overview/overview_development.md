summary: Start building functionality to enable your application or system to consume or expose data
---

- familiarise yourself with HL7&reg; FHIR&reg; ([developer introduction](http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/overview-dev.html){:target="_blank"}, [executive summary](http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/summary.html){:target="_blank"}, or [clinical intro](http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/overview-clinical.html){:target="_blank"})
 - read our GP Connect [FHIR&reg; API guidance](development_fhir_api_guidance.html) common to all APIs
 - read about [clinical safety requirements](designprinciples_clinical_safety_principles.html) for clinical system suppliers
- grab an [open source FHIR development library](development_fhir_open_source_guidance.html) for your favourite programming language
- which serialisation format should I choose as an GP Connect API consumer - NHS Digital recommends all new consumer systems use JSON - see [Frequently asked questions](support_faq.html) for more information
- explore the GP Connect profiled FHIR resources, a variation of the international [FHIR resources](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/STU3/){:target="_blank"}, for [Foundations](datalibraryfoundation.html), [Access Record HTML](datalibraryaccessRecord.html), and [Appointment Management](datalibraryappointment.html)
- dig in deep and explore one or more of the GP Connect capability packs and start building new or hitting existing APIs
  - [Foundations](foundations.html) (for example, resolve a patient to their logical identifier for further API calls)
  	- note the Foundations prerequisites are mandatory and may restrict your ability to utilise the GP Connect APIs
  - [Access Record HTML](accessrecord.html) (for example, access HTML views from the primary care record)
  - [Access Record Structured](accessrecord_structured_copy.html) (for example, access structured data from the primary care record)
  - [Appointment Management](appointments.html) (for example, book an appointment for a patient)  
- take a look at cross-cutting areas:
  - JSON Web Token - provides [cross-organisation audit and provenance](integration_cross_organisation_audit_and_provenance.html) details
  - additional HTTP headers and proxy URL - this gives you access to the [Spine Security Proxy](integration_spine_secure_proxy.html), the secure 'front door' of GP Connect APIs
  - configure HTTPS and TLS/MA - [security guidance](development_api_security_guidance.html) allows you to secure and mutually authenticate your service with the Spine (which refers to two parties authenticating each other at the same time)
