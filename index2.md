GP Connect has worked with GP clinical system suppliers to develop *[APIs]: Application Programming Interfaces.

These APIs make data from clinical systems available in a standard form so that it can be used across different systems and be made available to clinicians who need access to the data for direct patient care.

The APIs are grouped into separate [capabilities](/overview_priority_capabilities.html), so that clinicians in different care settings can:  

* view a patient’s GP practice record - [Access Record HTML](/accessrecord.html)
*	manage a patient's GP appointments - [Appointment Management](/appointments.html)
* import or download medication and allergies information - [Access Record Structured](/accessrecord_structured/accessrecord_structured.html) 

## Using this specification ##

This specification has been created to support the adoption of GP Connect APIs and FHIR&reg; resources. Follow the steps below to complete your development journey using GP Connect APIs:

## Pilot using the GP Connect APIs ##
The GP Connect programme is now supporting the development of systems that connect with the APIs to use data from patient records and appointment schedulers for patient care by integrating it or importing it into local clinical systems.

We’re working with selected partnerships of health and care organisations and software suppliers. Partnerships will use the APIs to develop technical solutions to local issues with sharing patient records and appointment booking across system boundaries.
We’ve developed a process called ‘First of Type’ to support this development and provide assurance for these early products.
